I have three accounts and one of the three is marked as inactive.""","## My account already exists – what can I do?

If the message “E-mail address already in use” is displayed during the registration process, you probably already have an acount or tried to create one. In this case, enter your e-mail address in the section “Login” of the start page. If you have forgotten your password, you can reset it by clicking on “Forgot password?” in the connection section. Next, enter your e-mail adress and click on “Send”. You will receive an e-mail with a link to reset your password; after having chosen a new password you can connect to your account again.  Attention: If you already have a user account for the old search engine, this account remains valid for the new search engine too!

## How do I download a digitised document?

To download a document simply click on  then on . For practical reasons you cannot download more than 100 pages per day. Digitised iconographic documents, such as maps and plans or photographs, cannot be downloaded."

## How do I report errors or leave comments in Archive inventories?

Errors or comments can be reported via the contact form or via A question? An error?, on the inventory page. Please describe the error as clearly as possible. If you have found an error in a description (e.g. the document does not date from 1885 but from 1858), please be sure to mention the URL, title and code of the inventory as well as the number of the item.
If you have noticed a problem on the website (e.g. a button not working), please tell us which browser you are using and where exactly the problem occurs."

Dear Alice,

I am experiencing problems logging in to https://genealogie.arch.be/results/

However, I have successfully logged in to https://search.arch.be/en/

I have not received the expected activation email, neither in my spam folder nor otherwise.

Best regards,

We have activated your account manually. You can log in with your username or email address. If you forget your password, you can reset it by clicking on 'Forgot Password'. We recommend changing your password when you first log in to avoid future problems (note that the old password for the search robot has also been changed!).

Don't hesitate to contact us if you still encounter problems!

Best of luck with your research!

Kind regards,
Dylan

Dear Charlie,

It doesn't work to log in...
Can you look into this?

 Re: Genealogical sources - Problem with registration or connection

Dear Charlie,

The login still gives problems?
On the old site search arch, I can log in; when I then go to https://genealogie.arch.be/results/ it asks me to log in again and that doesn't work either
Can you offer a temporary solution so I can continue my search?

Would it be possible to try logging in again? If it still doesn't work, we will delete your account in full, so you can register again.

The account is valid for the entire AGATHA search environment. It is only mandatory for the Genealogical Sources and Archive Inventories search engines (coming soon) however, as they both contain digitised archives. To find out how to register, see “How do I create an account?”.

## I forgot my password – what can I do?

If you have forgotten your password, you can reset it by clicking on “Forgot password?” in the connection section. Next, enter your e-mail adress and click on “Send”. You will receive an e-mail with a link to reset your password; after having chosen a new password you can connect to your account again."
