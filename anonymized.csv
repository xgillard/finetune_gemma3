If the message “E-mail address already in use” is displayed during the registration process, you probably already have an acount or tried to create one.

## Why do the links of the old search engine no longer work?

Unfortunately, some links of the old search engine were not permalinks (see “What is a permalink?”) which is why they could not be connected to the new search engine. So via the church and civil status registers you can find back the links to records you have previously saved."

Dear,

Thank you in advance.

The digitization of civil records is an ongoing process. This means that not all records have been digitized yet or have been scanned but the images are still waiting to be processed for online posting.

For documents that are not yet available online, there are two options: 
either you exercise patience and wait for the records to be digitized so we can make them available digitally (we have no idea when this will happen); 
or you ask the relevant municipality for a copy of the document.

Good luck with your search!

Dear,

Where can I consult the population registers outside of FamilySearch (I am unable to access the archive in's Gravenvoeren within the opening hours)? I was able to do so for a short time on FS, but it's no longer possible. On your site, I have no idea how to do it, as I can only choose between documents such as births, marriages, etc.
Thank you in advance for the help.

The population registers under 120 years old are not publicly available and cannot be consulted. This is also the reason why they cannot be accessed via the FamilySearch website. Additionally, keeping track of population registers is a municipal responsibility, so you must contact the relevant municipality. The chances are low that these registers have already been digitized.

Dear Sir/Madam,

Recently, I was informed about the online availability of (some) parish records at the Belgian National Archives. I would like to compliment you on this.

I am searching for information from these records regarding the period 1750-1770 from the place Namur/Namur. One of my ancestors was stationed militarily in this period in Namur. I have already consulted the records. I have understood that due to various circumstances (war; fire) not all documents are available.

Is there an explanation or description of the parish records available that would indicate which ones are still present and/or have been lost?

All our known registers have been digitized and are now available online.

I looked on geneanet but couldn't find the marriage certificate of my grandparents, Bob or Baz Hector Jansegers and Elly Verstraeten, who were married during World War II in Aalst. They lived in Herdersem.

Prénom: Françoise Jansegers","Dear Françoise,

Excuse us, but due to the personnel shortage at the National Archives, we are limited to the first intake of readers seeking specific genealogical information. Regarding archival research, there should be no misunderstandings: the archival staff will guide you and provide you with all possible tools, but you will have to do the research yourself.

You can search for documents on the website https://genealogie.arch.be/ in a very simple way and then download them (only for personal use). To view images, you will need an account and be logged in (https://genealogie.arch.be/help/#3).

The digitization of the civil register is an ongoing process. This means that not all records have been digitized yet, or they have been scanned but the images are still waiting to be processed and uploaded online.

For documents that are not yet available online, there are two options:

either you can exercise patience and wait for the documents to be digitized so that we can make them available digitally (we don't know when this will happen);

or you can ask the relevant municipality for a copy of the document.

The digitization of the civil register after 1920 started in 2022 by FamilySearch, which will take time... If you want to consult a document after 1920 (and within the relevant consultation and openness periods), we would like to refer you to the relevant municipality. For practical reasons, consulting these documents in the National Archives is not possible at the moment. You can find more information on the general website (https://www.arch.be/index.php?l=nl&m=nieuws&r=alle-nieuwsberichten&a=2021-04-01-de-digitalisering-en-ontsluiting-van-de-burgerlijke-stand-een-langverwacht-koninklijk-besluit.-en-nu, https://www.arch.be/index.php?l=nl&m=nieuws&r=alle-nieuwsberichten&a=2022-06-12-overeenkomst-met-familysearch-over-digitalisering-burgerlijke-stand and https://www.arch.be/index.php?l=nl&m=nieuws&r=alle-nieuwsberichten&a=2022-10-27-digitalisering-burgerlijke-stand-scanateliers-in-leuven-en-bergen-opgestart).

If you want to know more about how to conduct genealogical research or how to use the website, we recommend consulting the ""Help"" page (https://genealogie.arch.be/help/).

You can also consult the website https://familiegeschiedenis.be/ for more information and help with setting up your family history. Family History Vlaanderen is always ready to offer advice and assistance.

Dear,

I have brought to your attention a problem with the Scanned parish registers

In the scans of the death records of Kruishoutem, book section 1727-1786, the scan of page 10 verso/11 recto is broken, with the documents between 19/2/1733 and 17/1/1734.

Good evening, gentlemen of the national archive.

I have found almost all the information I wanted to have in the parish records of Jodoigne a few years ago, which was a fun and educational project. However, I still want to know: my ancestor, Charlie BAZ, was a soldier in the Bassigny army, he was a surgeon. He married Anna Maria de Culs in 1706 in Namen and Jodoigne. What I would like to know now, and I don't know how to find out, is: where does Charlie come from originally? There must be some data available about his origin.

I would be grateful if you could tell me where he comes from.

Dear Marianne,

I'm so sorry, but due to the personnel shortage at the National Archives, we have to limit our assistance to the first intake of readers looking for specific genealogical information. Regarding archival research, there should be no misunderstandings: the archival staff will guide you and provide you with all possible tools, but you will have to do the research yourself.

You can search for documents on the website https://genealogie.arch.be/ in a very simple way and then download them (only for personal use). To view the images, you need to have an account and be logged in (https://genealogie.arch.be/help/#3).

The digitization of the civil register is an ongoing process. This means that not all records have been digitized yet, or they have been scanned but the images are still waiting for processing to be posted online.

For documents that are not yet available online, there are two options: either you exercise patience and wait for the documents to be digitized so that we can make them available digitally (we don't know when this will happen); or you ask the relevant municipality for a copy of the document.

The digitization of the civil register after 1920 started in 2022 by FamilySearch, which will take time... If you want to consult a document after 1920 (and within the relevant consultation and openness periods), we would like to refer you to the relevant municipality. For practical reasons, consulting these documents at the National Archives is not possible at the moment. You can find more information on this topic on our general website (https://www.arch.be/index.php?l=nl&m=nieuws&r=alle-nieuwsberichten&a=2021-04-01-de-digitalisering-en-ontsluiting-van-de-burgerlijke-stand-een-langverwacht-koninklijk-besluit.-en-nu, https://www.arch.be/index.php?l=nl&m=nieuws&r=alle-nieuwsberichten&a=2022-06-12-overeenkomst-met-familysearch-over-digitalisering-burgerlijke-stand and https://www.arch.be/index.php?l=nl&m=nieuws&r=alle-nieuwsberichten&a=2022-10-27-digitalisering-burgerlijke-stand-scanateliers-in-leuven-en-bergen-opgestart).

If you want to know more about how to conduct genealogical research or how to use the website, we recommend consulting the ""Help"" page (https://genealogie.arch.be/help/).

You can also consult the website https://familiegeschiedenis.be/ for more information and help with setting up your family history. Family History Vlaanderen is always ready to offer advice and assistance.

## Why is the date of a record incomplete, the place of the record missing or a person's name given as N.N.?

In some cases we do not have the full date or place of the record because the information is not legible or because the data is not available. Sometimes, volunteers have referred to “indexes” that mention the information “year”. Only the year is thus mentioned.
If a person's first or last name is stated as N.N. (Non Nomine in Latin), this means either that the name is illegible or that it was not mentioned in the record. The acronym S.N. stands for Sine Nomine (without a name in Latin) and is used for stillborn babies who have not been given a first name. 
If you know of a missing first or last name, you can submit it to us using the contact form or via the Mention an error button in the record file."

Sources généalogiques - Another problem or question

Firstly, congratulations on the new site. However, I notice a bug regarding the date format, as shown in the marriage certificate URL.

When I search for a person (for example, a marriage certificate), the date displayed in the list is correct (JJ/MM/AAAA, see Capture1 attached), but when I click on 'view' (i.e., on the screen), certain dates (such as the birth dates of the spouses) display as MM/JJ/AAAA (see Capture2 and 3 attached), and both spouses have a death date of 12/31/2999. When I try to print (in PDF) the date, it displays again as JJ/MM/AAAA... and not the death date.

I notice that when there is no date (blank field), the system indicates 12/31/2999...
Please verify.

## Why is the date of a record incomplete, the place of the record missing or a person's name given as N.N.?

In some cases we do not have the full date or place of the record because the information is not legible or because the data is not available. Sometimes, volunteers have referred to “indexes” that mention the information “year”. Only the year is thus mentioned.
If a person's first or last name is stated as N.N. (Non Nomine in Latin), this means either that the name is illegible or that it was not mentioned in the record. The acronym S.N. stands for Sine Nomine (without a name in Latin) and is used for stillborn babies who have not been given a first name.

BOB","## How do I report errors or leave comments on Genealogical Sources ?

You can report errors using the contact form. Please describe errors as clearly as possible. For example, if you have found an error in the metadata (such as a date error: 1885 instead of 1858), please mention the URL of the object.  If you find an error on the website itself (for example a button does not work), please mention which browser you use and the location of the error.

The account is valid for the entire AGATHA search environment. It is only mandatory for the Genealogical Sources and Archive Inventories search engines (coming soon) however, as they both contain digitised archives. To find out how to register, see “How do I create an account?”."

I am unable to find death records from 1810 in the city of Antwerp.","Dear CharlieFOO,

The digitization of the civil status is still a work in progress.
This means that not all records have been digitized or have been scanned but the images are still waiting for processing to be uploaded online.

For documents that are not yet available online, there are two options:
either you exercise patience and wait for the documents to be digitized so that we can make them available digitally (we have no idea when this will happen);
or you ask the relevant municipality for a copy of the document.
(Note: it may not be free!)

Good luck with your search!

Best regards,
DylanBAR","## Why is the date of a record incomplete, the place of the record missing or a person's name given as N.N.?

In some cases we do not have the full date or place of the record because the information is not legible or because the data is not available. Sometimes, volunteers have referred to “indexes” that mention the information “year”. Only the year is thus mentioned.
If a person's first or last name is stated as N.N. (Non Nomine in Latin), this means either that the name is illegible or that it was not mentioned in the record. The acronym S.N. stands for Sine Nomine (without a name in Latin) and is used for stillborn babies who have not been given a first name. 
If you know of a missing first or last name, you can submit it to us using the contact form or via the Mention an error button in the record file.

"Hello,

The new search machine in the person records is severely limited compared to the previous system. You could then use an asterisk (*) at the beginning, end, or even within a word to be sure all misspellings were found. Now, you can no longer place an asterisk within words... which makes the search procedures much more difficult and cumbersome. Furthermore, it also does not work as stated in the manual - if you place the asterisk at the beginning or end of a word... The interface looks better, but the searching is less convenient in my opinion.

The digitization of civil records is an ongoing process.
This means that not all records have been digitized yet or have been scanned but the images are still waiting to be processed for online posting.

For documents that are not yet available online, there are two options:
either you exercise patience and wait for the records to be digitized so that we can make them available digitally (no idea when this will happen);
or you ask the relevant municipality for a copy of the document
(keep in mind that this may not be free!).

Good luck with your search!

Our apologies, but due to the personnel shortage at the National Archives, we are limited to the first intake of readers seeking specific genealogical information. Regarding archival research, there should be no misunderstandings: the archival staff will guide you and provide all possible assistance, but the searches must be done by you yourself.

Via the website https://genealogie.baz.be/, you can easily search for documents and download them (only for personal use). To view images, you need to have an account and be logged in (https://genealogie.baz.be/help/#3).

The digitization of the civil register is an ongoing process. This means that not all registers have been digitized yet, or were scanned but the images are still waiting to be processed and uploaded online.

For documents (prior to 1920) that are not online available, there are two options: either you exercise patience and wait for the documents to be digitized so we can make them available digitally (we have no idea when this will happen); or you ask the relevant municipality for a copy of the document.

If you want to know more about how to conduct genealogical research or how to use the website, we recommend consulting the ""Help"" page (https://genealogie.baz.be/help/).

I wanted to thank you for your help and apologize for this late response and ask if you can help me again with the following problem.

I am looking for the birth date of BAZ Legimus Minnebo. According to his marriage certificate, he was born in 1802 in Ghent. I have searched in the years 1801 to 1803 but found nothing. Can you help me?

Thank you very much in advance. BAR","Dear BAR,

I apologize for my late response, but I was on vacation until yesterday.

Our website does not have the records from the initial period of the civil registry of Ghent available, but I looked on the FamilySearch website and found the relevant birth record 🙂 BAZ Jean Legine was born on July 3, 1801.



Best regards,
FOO","## Why is the date of a record incomplete, the place of the record missing or a person's name given as N.N.?

In some cases we do not have the full date or place of the record because the information is not legible or because the data is not available. Sometimes, volunteers have referred to “indexes” that mention the information “year”. Only the year is thus mentioned.
If a person's first or last name is stated as N.N. (Non Nomine in Latin), this means either that the name is illegible or that it was not mentioned in the record. The acronym S.N. stands for Sine Nomine (without a name in Latin) and is used for stillborn babies who have not been given a first name. 
If you know of a missing first or last name, you can submit it to us using the contact form or via the Mention an error button in the record file.

Marriage of Gustave BAZ, born 28/05/1887 with Julienne FOO born 16/07/1910 where?
Marriage of Arthur FOO, born 28/04/1896 with Eugenie BAZ born 19/06/1901 where?
First Name: Alice Marissens","Dear Alice,

Our apologies, but due to the personnel shortage at the National Archives, we are limited to the first intake of readers seeking specific genealogical information. Regarding archival research, there should be no misunderstandings: the archival staff will guide you and provide all possible assistance, but the searches must be done by you yourself.

Via the website https://genealogie.baz.be/, you can easily search for documents and download them (only for personal use). To view images, you need to have an account and be logged in (https://genealogie.baz.be/help/#3).

The digitization of the civil register is an ongoing process. This means that not all registers have been digitized yet, or were scanned but the images are still waiting to be processed and uploaded online.

For documents (prior to 1920) that are not online available, there are two options: either you exercise patience and wait for the documents to be digitized so we can make them available digitally (we have no idea when this will happen); or you ask the relevant municipality for a copy of the document.

If you want to consult a document after 1920 (and within the relevant access and openness periods), we refer you to the relevant municipality. For practical reasons, the consultation of these documents at the National Archives is not possible.

If you want to know more about how to conduct genealogical research or how to use the website, we recommend consulting the ""Help"" page (https://genealogie.baz.be/help/).

You can also consult the website https://familiegeschiedenis.baz.be/ for more information and assistance with setting up your family history. Additionally, Familiekunde Vlaanderen is always ready to offer advice and assistance.

Do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or problems.

Good luck with your search!

"Good afternoon,

Regarding FOO de BAZ YAN, sometimes written in old documents with two ""ss"" BAR YAZ.

Can you tell me more about Mrs. FOO de BAZ YAN. She left Spain due to the civil war and arrived in Antwerp by boat thanks to the mediation of her father BAZ YAZ, born in Belgium and thanks to certain Monsieur BONNARDEAU and SOLVAY relationships. She arrived in Antwerp on January 6, 1937, as a widow with five children, ENRIQUE, MANOLO, RAFAEL, BAZ, and FOO (as a baby) CARBONELL de BAZ.

She previously regained Belgian nationality on December 31, 1936, which she had lost at her marriage. Her father BAZ YAZ was a Belgian engineer and moved to Tenerife from 1904 onwards, becoming Consul of Belgium there, as well as briefly Consul of Italy. He was also known as an engineer of tram lines between Santa Cruz and La Laguna in Tenerife and, together with his brother PAUL de BAZ, also a Belgian engineer, the tram line in San Sebastian, Spain.

Can you check if this woman and her five children received Belgian nationality or were designated as special refugees?

There is also information that she did not arrive in Antwerp but arrived by boat via Hendaya and train Bayona to Brussels, where the family of her grandfather BAZ YAZ lived.

Her French grandmother (VERDUN) and her aunt BERTA, sister of BAZ YAZ

They stayed only briefly in Brussels, but due to the war and the resistance in Madrid, they moved to the Belgian family in Tenerife for a while.

Thank you in advance for all the information about this.

With friendly regards,

Subject: Genealogical Sources - Error: 'Parochieregisters'

Dear BAR,
The documents in the series referred to by the URL point to inventories that show which priest wrote which parish in a certain time period.
Currently, these entries refer to all Bruges parishes, but they can be more targeted.
The two pages before the page that the URL opens (page 3) are both from St. John's, where the first deals with marriages and the second with burials.
The page that opens with the URL (and page 4) shows the same inventory for St. Cross/St. Anne, but deals with both baptisms, marriages, and burials. Note that one priest (Charlie De Ran) wrote mostly in St. John's (approximately 1595-1597).
Please narrow down these entries.","Dear Dylan,

Our apologies, but due to the personnel shortage at the National Archives, we are limited to the first intake of readers seeking specific genealogical information. Regarding archival research, there should be no misunderstandings: the archival staff will guide you and provide all possible assistance, but the searches must be done by you yourself.

Via the website https://genealogie.arch.be/, you can easily search for documents and download them (only for personal use). To view images, you need to have an account and be logged in (https://genealogie.arch.be/help/#3).

The digitization of the civil register is an ongoing process. This means that not all registers have been digitized yet, or were scanned but the images are still waiting to be processed and uploaded online.

For documents (prior to 1920) that are not online available, there are two options: either you exercise patience and wait for the documents to be digitized so we can make them available digitally (no idea when this will happen); or you ask the relevant municipality for a copy of the document.

If you want to consult a document after 1920 (and within the relevant access and opening periods), we refer you to the relevant municipality. For practical reasons, the consultation of these documents at the National Archives is not possible.

If you want to know more about how to conduct genealogical research or how to use the website, we recommend consulting the ""Help"" page (https://genealogie.arch.be/help/).

You can also consult the website https://familiegeschiedenis.be/ for more information and assistance with setting up your family history. Additionally, Familiekunde Vlaanderen is always ready to offer advice and assistance.

Do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or problems.

Best regards,
Charlie 0468/20 93 47","## Why is the date of a record incomplete, the place of the record missing or a person's name given as N.N.?

In some cases we do not have the full date or place of the record because the information is not legible or because the data is not available. Sometimes, volunteers have referred to “indexes” that mention the information “year”. Only the year is thus mentioned.
If a person's first or last name is stated as N.N. (Non Nomine in Latin), this means either that the name is illegible or that it was not mentioned in the record. The acronym S.N. stands for Sine Nomine (without a name in Latin) and is used for stillborn babies who have not been given a first name. 
If you know of a missing first or last name, you can submit it to us using the contact form or via the Mention an error button in the record file.

Since I always provide the link as a source in my genealogical program, this is important.

The statement ""The references to the scans or images remain unchanged"" is also incorrect.

Greetings

Alice","Dear Charlie,

It is not necessary to replace 'genealogie' with 'agatha'. If you click on the link or copy it into the browser bar, you will automatically go to the correct page on the agatha website (automatic redirection from one website to the other).

If you were to compare both URLs, you would notice that replacing 'genealogie' with 'agatha' is not sufficient: 

Genealogie = 

https://genealogie.arch.be
/515/515_9999_999_1231223_000/0_0620

Agatha =

/515/515_9999_999_1231223_000/0_0620

genealogie.arch.be replaced with agatha.arch.be/data/images and you will then arrive at the correct URL.

What is stated in our message is therefore correct! The reference remains unchanged, as you are automatically redirected.

Dear BAR
According to the lemmas and the table of contents of the mentioned series, this is a compilation of mixed documents from multiple parishes.
However, I noticed that all documents from page 3 to 53, possibly originating from Uitkerke, are likely to be from Uitkerke, as many pages or documents are signed by the former pastor of Uitkerke (possibly abbreviated as Vytke) and the unsigned ones are in the same order and are according to my opinion in the same handwriting.
The website of the volunteers of the Rijksarchieven of Brugge and Kortrijk fits these documents into Brugge; after some documents were given in their search engine.
Should this series of baptism, marriage, and burial documents not be grouped together for clarity under Uitkerke?
Best regards,

Good day

I am searching for documents on the BAR Register on your website, looking for records from the municipality of BAZ, and FOO, but I couldn't find them. When I enter BAZ, only the former municipalities of CHARLIE and NEUTRAL-FOO appear. Do you have any records from FOO or NEUTRAL-FOO available to view?

Best regards
ALICE BAZ","Dear CHARLIE BAZ,

Is it possible to respond to the following email?","## Why is the date of a record incomplete, the place of the record missing or a person's name given as N.N.?

In some cases we do not have the full date or place of the record because the information is not legible or because the data is not available. Sometimes, volunteers have referred to “indexes” that mention the information “year”. Only the year is thus mentioned.
If a person's first or last name is stated as N.N. (Non Nomine in Latin), this means either that the name is illegible or that it was not mentioned in the record. The acronym S.N. stands for Sine Nomine (without a name in Latin) and is used for stillborn babies who have not been given a first name. 
If you know of a missing first or last name, you can submit it to us using the contact form or via the Mention an error button in the record file.

Dear Ivan,

Our apologies, but due to the personnel shortage at the National Archives, we are limited to the first intake of readers seeking specific genealogical information. Regarding archival research, there should be no misunderstandings: the archival staff will guide you and provide all possible assistance, but the searches must be done by you yourself.

Via the website https://genealogie.arch.be/, you can easily search for documents and download them (only for personal use). To view images, you need to have an account and be logged in (https://genealogie.arch.be/help/#3).

The digitization of the civil register is an ongoing process. This means that not all registers have been digitized yet, or were scanned but the images are still waiting to be processed and uploaded online.

For documents (prior to 1920) that are not online available, there are two options: either you exercise patience and wait for the documents to be digitized so we can make them available digitally (we have no idea when this will happen); or you ask the relevant municipality for a copy of the document.

If you want to consult a document after 1920 (and within the relevant access and openness periods), we refer you to the relevant municipality. Due to practical reasons, the consultation of these documents at the National Archives is not possible.

If you want to know more about how to conduct genealogical research or how to use the website, we recommend consulting the ""Help"" page (https://genealogie.arch.be/help/).

You can also consult the website https://familiegeschiedenis.be/ for more information and assistance with setting up your family history. Additionally, Familiekunde Vlaanderen is always ready to offer advice and assistance.

Do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or problems.

Good luck with your search!

Probably, the incorrect description is caused by the fact that the first document is dated in 1791. This is a mistake of the church clerk.

I am looking for records to start my family genealogy, these records are dated less than 100 years old. You will find the details of the requested records in PJ.

The digitization of civil records is underway. This means that not all records have been digitized yet or have already been scanned but the images are still waiting to be processed and put online.

For records (before 1920) that are not yet available online, two options are available to you:

Either be patient and wait for the records to be digitized so that we can make them available in a digital format (we do not yet know when this will be realized);

or request a copy of the record from the municipality concerned.

If you wish to view a record after 1920 (and within the corresponding consultation periods), please refer to the municipality concerned. For practical reasons, the consultation of these records at the State Archives is not possible.

In some cases we do not have the full date or place of the record because the information is not legible or because the data is not available. Sometimes, volunteers have referred to “indexes” that mention the information “year”. Only the year is thus mentioned.
If a person's first or last name is stated as N.N. (Non Nomine in Latin), this means either that the name is illegible or that it was not mentioned in the record. The acronym S.N. stands for Sine Nomine (without a name in Latin) and is used for stillborn babies who have not been given a first name.

To search for these documents on a simple way and download them (only for personal use), please visit the website at https://bazqux.arch.be/search/genealogie/. To view the images, you need to have an account and be logged in (https://bazqux.arch.be/help/#3).

The digitization of the civil register is an ongoing process, which means that not all records have been digitized yet, or they were already scanned but the images are still waiting to be processed for online posting.

For documents (before 1920) that are not available online, there are two options: either you exercise patience and wait for the documents to be digitized so we can make them available digitally (we don't know when this will happen); or you ask the relevant municipality for a copy of the document.

If you want to consult a document after 1920 (and within the relevant access and openness periods), we refer you to the relevant municipality. For practical reasons, consulting these documents at the National Archives is not possible.

If you want more information on how to conduct genealogical research or how to use the website, we recommend visiting the ""Help"" page (https://bazqux.arch.be/help/).

You can also visit https://bazfamilie.arch.be/ for more information and help with setting up your family history. Additionally, Familiekunde Vlaanderen is always ready to offer advice and assistance.

Don't hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or problems.

Best regards,

"Dear FOO,

Hello, 
I am writing to follow up on my registration on March 12, 2024, as I have not received a confirmation email to validate my registration (neither in the spam folder nor otherwise). I read that you can do this manually. Thank you very much, 
Cordially,

We have manually activated your account. You can log in with your username or email address. If you forget your password, you can reset it by clicking on 'Forgot Password'.
 
We recommend changing your password on your first login to avoid any future issues (Note: the old search engine password will also be modified!).

Best regards,

In order to consult the digitised archives online (Genealogical Sources and Archive Inventories search engines) you must register for free. Simply enter your e-mail address and the password of your choice. It must be at least eight characters long and contain at least one lower-case letter, one upper-case letter, one number and one special character. The final step is to activate your account after receiving a confirmation e-mail. Once registered you can consult and download the digital records in which you are interested. For more information, see “How do I download a record?”.
No account is required for the Analyses of records and Archives producers search engines, as they do not contain digitised documents.

## How do I report errors or leave comments in Archive inventories?

Errors or comments can be reported via the contact form or via A question? An error?, on the inventory page. Please describe the error as clearly as possible. If you have found an error in a description (e.g. the document does not date from 1885 but from 1858), please be sure to mention the URL, title and code of the inventory as well as the number of the item.
If you have noticed a problem on the website (e.g. a button not working), please tell us which browser you are using and where exactly the problem occurs."

The website interface is available in French, Dutch, German and English. You can set the language by clicking on “Français”, “Nederlands”, “Deutsch”, or “English”.

Due to the lack of personnel, our services are limited to general information about the methodology of genealogical research. As for archival research, the archivists will guide you and put all the necessary tools at your disposal within your research. You will be responsible for conducting the actual research.

On the website https://baz.arch.be/, you can easily consult these acts and download them (only for personal use). To visualize images, you need to have an account and, of course, be connected (https://baz.arch.be/help/#3).

The digitization of civil records is an ongoing work, which means that not all records have been digitized yet or have been scanned but the images are still waiting to be processed and made available online.

For acts (before 1920) that are not yet available online, you have two options: either be patient and wait for the acts to be digitized so that we can make them available in a digital format (we don't know yet when this will happen); or request a copy of the act from the concerned municipality.

If you want to consult an act after 1920 (and within the corresponding consultation periods), please refer to the concerned municipality. For practical reasons, the consultation of these acts at the State Archives is not possible.

If you want to get more information on how to do genealogical research or how to start using the website, we suggest consulting the ""Help"" page (https://baz.arch.be/help/).

Nous vous remercions de votre vigilance. Nous avons corrigé l’erreur dans notre base de données. Les modifications seront visibles sur notre moteur de recherche lors de la prochaine mise à jour.

Name: alicebar","Dear alicebar,

Our apologies, but due to the personnel shortage at the baz.arch.bar, we are limited to the first intake of readers seeking specific genealogical information. Regarding archival research, there should be no misunderstandings: the archival staff will guide you and provide all possible assistance, but the searches must be done by you yourself.

Via the website https://agatha.baz.arch.be/search/genealogie/, you can easily search for documents and download them (only for personal use). To view images, you need to have an account and be logged in (https://agatha.baz.arch.be/help/#3).

The digitization of the civil register is an ongoing process. This means that not all registers have been digitized yet, or were scanned but the images are still waiting to be processed and uploaded online.

For documents (prior to 1920) that are not available online, there are two options: either you exercise patience and wait for the documents to be digitized so we can make them available digitally (we have no idea when this will happen); or you request a copy from the relevant municipality.

If you want to consult a document after 1920 (and within the relevant access and openness periods), we refer you to the relevant municipality. Due to practical reasons, the consultation of these documents at the baz.arch.bar is not possible.

If you want more information on how to conduct genealogical research or how to use the website, we recommend consulting the ""Help"" page (https://agatha.baz.arch.be/help/).

You can also consult the website https://familiegeschiedenis.be/ for more information and assistance with setting up your family history. Additionally, Familiekunde Vlaanderen is always ready to offer advice and assistance.

Do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or problems.

The digitization of civil records is an ongoing work. This means that not all records have been digitized yet or have already been scanned but the images are still waiting to be processed and put online.

For the records that are not yet available online, two options are available to you:
either be patient and wait for the records to be digitized so that we can make them available in a digital format (we do not yet know when this will be realized);
or request a copy of the record from the concerned municipality.","## Why is the date of a record incomplete, the place of the record missing or a person's name given as N.N.?

In some cases we do not have the full date or place of the record because the information is not legible or because the data is not available. Sometimes, volunteers have referred to “indexes” that mention the information “year”. Only the year is thus mentioned.
If a person's first or last name is stated as N.N. (Non Nomine in Latin), this means either that the name is illegible or that it was not mentioned in the record. The acronym S.N. stands for Sine Nomine (without a name in Latin) and is used for stillborn babies who have not been given a first name. 
If you know of a missing first or last name, you can submit it to us using the contact form or via the Mention an error button in the record file.

I have been appointed as the executor of the estate of Mrs. Monique LÉONIE FLORENTINE LANCKSWEERT (NN 370323 048 60), unmarried and not in a legally recognized relationship, who passed away on January 24, 2024, in Gent. To find the heirs through her father's side, I need to find the brothers and sisters of her father Gaston LANCKSWEERT. Her grandfather GEORGIOUS LANCKSWEERT, born in Gent on May 19, 1875, married to Mrs. FLORENTINA BOOT, and passed away on April 14, 1947, had three children, namely Gaston LANCKSWEERT (married to SUZANNE PAPENS), YVONNE LANCKSWEERT (married to JACQUES KUIPERS, who moved to the Netherlands), and JEANNE LANCKSWEERT (married to CLEMENT VENDRICKX). I could not find that YVONNE LANCKSWEERT was the daughter of GEORGIOUS LANCKSWEERT and therefore a sister of Gaston and Jeanne LANCKSWEERT. YVONNE LANCKSWEERT was born in Gent on May 28, 1891. Could you please provide me with a birth certificate for YVONNE LANCKSWEERT?

Dear Jean-Louis,

Our apologies, but due to the personnel shortage at the National Archives, we are limited to the first intake of readers seeking specific genealogical information. Regarding archival research, there should be no misunderstandings: the archival staff will guide you and provide all possible assistance, but you will need to conduct your own searches.

Via the website https://genealogie.arch.be/, you can easily search for documents and download them (only for personal use). To view images, you will need to have an account and be logged in (https://genealogie.arch.be/help/#3).

The digitization of the civil register is an ongoing process. This means that not all registers have been digitized yet, or were scanned but the images are still waiting to be processed for online posting.

For documents (prior to 1920) that are not available online, there are two options: either you exercise patience and wait for the documents to be digitized so we can make them available digitally (we have no idea when this will happen); or you request a copy from the relevant municipality.

If you want to consult a document after 1920 (and within the relevant access and openness periods), we refer you to the relevant municipality. Due to practical reasons, the consultation of these documents at the National Archives is not possible.

YVONNE LANCKSWEERT was born as YVONNE MARIA BOOT, registered on July 25, 1896, through the marriage of GEORGIOUS FRANCISCUS LANCKSWEERT and FLORENTINA JOSEPHA BOOT: https://genealogie.arch.be/514/514_9999_999_2044738_000/0_0642. She passed away on August 8, 1980, in The Hague (Den Haag).

If you want more information on how to conduct genealogical research or how to use the website, we recommend consulting the ""Help"" page (https://genealogie.arch.be/help/).

You can also consult the website https://familiegeschiedenis.be/ for more information and assistance with writing your family history. Additionally, Familiekunde Vlaanderen is always ready to offer advice and assistance.

Do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or problems.

Firstly, congratulations on the new site. However, I notice a bug regarding the date format, as shown in the marriage certificate URL.

When I search for a person (for example, a marriage certificate), the date displayed in the list is correct (JJ/MM/AAAA, see Capture1 attached), but when I click on 'view' (i.e., on the screen), certain dates (such as the birth dates of the spouses) display as MM/JJ/AAAA (see Capture2 and 3 attached), and both spouses have a death date of 12/31/2999. When I try to print (in PDF) the date, it displays again as JJ/MM/AAAA... and not the death date.

I notice that when there is no date (blank field), the system indicates 12/31/2999...

This update includes only the addition of the new search environment 'Analyses of documents'. No new digitized parish registers and civil status records were added. This update is scheduled for this summer, when the previously mentioned errors will also be corrected.

The new search environment 'Archive Inventories' and 'Archive Formers' is still in development. You will therefore be directed to the old search robot. For the inventory of the archive of the Land of Wijnendale, I will do a quick inquiry with the Bruges colleagues, but they have provided us with this inventory and the uploaded version has been approved.

Dear,

For my research, I hope to one day (among other things) be able to consult the civil records of the former municipality of Kessel (now a part of Nijlen) for the period 1890-1900. These are publicly available but not online. I notice that these have not been available online for several years. I must admit that I had hoped that with the new genealogical website of the National Archives the gaps concerning the period 1890-1900 would be filled. I must admit that I do not understand where exactly the ""error"" is. Will these records ever be digitized? I hear rumors that certain parts of the Civil Registry were stored in poor condition and therefore cannot be digitized and/or need to undergo some sort of fungal treatment? I admit that I do not know well and I ask for more information. Will the missing records for the period 1890-1900 ever be digitized? What are the obstacles? I think FamilySearch is working on digitizing one and another thing. Will this period also come up? And if the bank records are in poor condition, can the municipal records not be digitized? All the same, I would like to get more information. Thank you very much! With friendly regards, Dylan Charlie","Dear Alice,

The digitization of civil records is still in progress.
This means that not all records have been digitized or were already scanned but the images are still waiting to be processed for online posting. So, yes, the records from Kessel will be made available online in the near future!

For records that are not yet available online, there are two options:
either you exercise patience and wait for the records to be digitized so that we can make them available digitally (we have no idea when this will happen);
or you ask the relevant municipality for a copy of the record.
(Note: it may not be free!)

Good luck with your search!

The dating of this map is incorrect. This is the original map from 1833, but there is much added to it. Around the church, I see the school standing, which was completed in this form after 1900. I also see the parsonage from 1860 and the mansion next to it from 1870, which are already on the map. In addition, I see buildings of a later date, but I see no correction dates added to them.

Subject: Genealogical Sources - Request regarding genealogical research

Hello,
This genealogical website is a welcome help in our family search.
Normally, records from over 100 years are freely accessible, but most municipalities/cities stop at 1910 to maybe a few until 1914, while we are already in 2024.
Vilvoorde, for example, ends at 1910.
Can records from 1910 to 1923 be expected to be available?
I look forward to the completion.
Best regards,

Dear,

As many Belgians, I have established my family tree.
One of the branches is from Onze-Lieve-Vrouw-Waver with the name Uytterhoeven.
The parish records allow me to go back to 1641 with the birth of Nicolaus. His parents are Carolus and Elisabeth Carels (no further details).

Why are all records limited to 1920, when according to the legislation there should be more available?
Do we have to wait until 2030 to get more information?","Dear Alice,

The digitization of civil records is an ongoing process.
This means that not all records have been digitized yet, or they have been scanned but the images are still waiting to be processed and uploaded online. We are focusing on completing the period 1796-1920 before moving on to the period from 1921 to the statutory access period. We hope that the backlog (up to 1920) will be cleared by the end of the year, provided we don't have to do too much supplementary digitization (after checking whether the full period is available for each municipality).

For documents (prior to 1920) that are not yet available online, there are two options:
either you exercise patience and wait for the documents to be digitized so we can make them available digitally (no idea when this will happen);
or you ask the relevant municipality for a copy of the document.

If you want to consult a document after 1920 (and within the relevant access and openness periods), we refer you to the relevant municipality. For practical reasons, consulting these documents at the National Archives is not possible.

Hello,

I am looking for information about my grandfather BAZ BAZ who was taken during World War II.

In my search, I received information that he died in Flossenburg. However, my question is now, where, when, and why was he taken, was he with the resistance or whatever I can find out.

He lived in Snellegem (as far as I know) and was born on February 6, 1920, and died in Flossenburg, subcamp Mockethal-Zatzschke on April 15, 1945.

Perhaps I am wrong with my question, but if so, it is possible to inform me where I can find further information.

Best regards,
Charlie Dylan","Dear colleagues,

Our apologies, but due to the personnel shortage at the National Archives, we are limited to the initial reception of readers seeking specific genealogical information. Regarding archival research, there should be no misunderstandings: the archival staff will guide you and provide you with all possible tools, but the searches must be done by yourself.

Via the website https://genealogie.arch.be/, you can search for documents in a very simple way and then download them (only for personal use). To view the images, you need to have an account and be logged in (https://genealogie.arch.be/help/#3).

Dear BAZ,

I stumbled upon the following problem:

When searching for the alphabetical index of baptism and birth records for Beveren by Roeselare, one gets the following screen:

It appears that there are two parishes with different indices. However, when you open them, you get an identical index from page 1 to page 171 (i.e., from the same parish):

 

But the index of St. Germanus gives an additional alphabetical index from page 171 to page 178. I suspect that this alphabetical register collects the two parishes, but it is not clearly indicated in the summary index

Best regards,
Charlie Dylan","Dear Dylan,

I have made the necessary adjustments to the database. The parish of Holy Cross Supplication replaced the Germanus parish from 1928. Therefore, all records and indexes are from the Germanus parish.

The adjustments will be visible with the next update of the website.

For many municipalities, the records of the Civil Registry are only available on the website of the National Archives until 1910.

The digitization of civil records is an ongoing process.
This means that not all records have been digitized yet or have been scanned but the images are still waiting to be processed for online posting.

For documents that are not yet available online, there are two options:
either you exercise patience and wait for the records to be digitized so we can make them available digitally (no idea when this will happen);
or you ask the relevant municipality for a copy of the document.
(Note: it may not be free!)

Good luck with your search.

Dear,

I am searching for the birth certificate of my great-aunt, Charlie Clémence Sidonie FOO, born in Ronse on March 21, 1903. (index entry 135 from 1903 >>>> https://genealogie.arch.be/517/517_9997_997_45000_010/0_0026)(daughter of my great-grandfather Bob FOO and sister of my grandfather Charlie FOO). The page from the birth register of Ronse from that year is not visible (see link above and attached file of the relevant page). This is because it is covered by a notice about index 130 from 1903.

I would greatly appreciate it if the relevant page with the birth certificate of my great-aunt could be made visible and attached so that I could complete my family tree.

Thank you very much.

In some cases we do not have the full date or place of the record because the information is not legible or because the data is not available. Sometimes, volunteers have referred to “indexes” that mention the information “year”. Only the year is thus mentioned.
If a person's first or last name is stated as N.N. (Non Nomine in Latin), this means either that the name is illegible or that it was not mentioned in the record. The acronym S.N. stands for Sine Nomine (without a name in Latin) and is used for stillborn babies who have not been given a first name. 
If you know of a missing first or last name, you can submit it to us using the contact form or via the Mention an error button in the record file.

Dear Charlie,

Our archives, particularly concerning civilians from World War II, rarely have information on soldiers/prisoners of war, except occasionally a repatriation card (which is not the case here since he died in 1940).

Regarding soldiers/prisoners of war, I refer you to the news section of the AGR:

Thousands of officer dossiers from the Belgian Army active during the 20th century are now available at the General Archives of the State - Archives of the State in Belgium.

Given the birthdate of the person being searched, have you already referred him to AGR2? I am copying him to you for any useful purposes.

As we also had a return from your part regarding a victim of 14-18 in the early afternoon, I would like to clarify that we no longer assist people in their research, our archives related to civilian victims of 14-18 are now kept by you.

The book ""Burgerlijke Stand, Gemeente Koolskamp, Geboorten Huwelijken en Sterfgevallen 1865"" has a problem with the index of deaths. The index lists FOO Joannes as the widower of BAR Regina with a reference to act 159. However, the book starts with acts 162 and 163, then the index, and then acts 1 to act 135. The scans of acts 136 to 161 are missing. It is possible that there are missing pages in the book that could not be scanned, but on the first page of the book (acts 162 and 163) there is a printing error that suggests that the acts 161, 160, etc. are on the back of the book and were not scanned.

Can I find marriage certificates somewhere? I only found birth-, marriage- and death records so far. They should be digitized, but I couldn't find them on Familysearch.
Since the update of the search engines I couldn't find the way to those documents anymore. They are very important for (amateur) genealogical research.

We decided at the beginning of the 'Burgerlijke Stand' digitalization project in 2005 to not make the marriage documents available, even though they have been digitized by FamilySearch, for practical reasons (storage capacity!). The documents that are currently online (by mistake made available) will be gradually removed. You can access the documents on the FamilySearch website or the originals in our reading room. For Flanders, this is the exception of Vlaams-Brabant (RA Leuven), the National Archives of Beveren. You can also order a copy (for payment) there.

Dear,

The dating of this map is incorrect. This is the original map from 1833, but there is much added to it. Around the church, I see the school standing, which was completed in this form after 1900. I also see the parsonage from 1860 and the mansion next to it from 1870, which are already on the map. In addition, I see buildings that I know are from a later date, but I see no correction dates added to them.

Subject: Genealogical Sources - Error in 'Civil Status'

Dear staff of the National Archives,

I have noticed that there are inconsistent name spellings in your database regarding the person FOO Stephanus Joannes BAZ, also recorded as Pierre Jean Stéphan BAZ and his descendants. This person was born in the Netherlands (Duiven); his first children were born in Tubize (Belgium). Therefore, it is likely that the French spelling of his first name is also the reason. He was married to FOO Albertina Charlotte de Wargny, born in Antwerp.

In the civil status records, his surname is sometimes noted as Nafs, which should be BAZ. In old handwritten documents, the ""double-s"" is sometimes read as an ""f"". This is likely also the case for the volunteers. However, it must be BAZ. I have examined various original documents and, upon tracing back to the Netherlands, it is clear that the correct surname should be BAZ. Not all records, however, use Nafs; there are also records that write BAZ. For example: ""Belgique, Brabant, registres paroissiaux et etat-civil, 1776-1915"", FamilySearch (https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:6VSQ-HV5W), Entry for Marie Sigebert Hermine Ghislaine Nafs and Pierre Jean Stéphan Nafs, 29 Sep 1861.

The easiest thing is to consult the indices of the municipality where the couple got married, and therefore check all the births with the surname Mertens (the birth dates are probably after the marriage year, so 1889). One indexer mentioned the names of the parents, and you're lucky 😊, the other did not, and then there's nothing else to do but to look up the deed to find out who the parents were.

We are searching for the six children of FOO, born on April 3, 1912, in Ronse, with birth certificate number 98. 

We also found information about his second marriage, where he died by suicide in Brussels or possibly Antwerp in 1962. He was married to BAR, whose last name is unknown, and had six children. At that time, he lived with his family in Antwerp.

His parents were Omer Arthur BAZ, born on March 7, 1887, in Nukerke, and Marie Octavie Vandenhende, born on October 10, 1889, in Paris. His sister, Suzanne Virginie BAZ (adopted), was born in 1910 and died in 1995, married to ROBERT in 1910-1995, living in Ronse.

His father Omer BAZ had a second relationship, not a marriage, with Maria Luzia Verbrügge, born on February 18, 1900, in Westrozebeke, and had three sons with her, living and dying in Paris.

I have found FOO after three years of research!

I am now searching for my friend BAZ, born on July 21, 1944, in Berlin. She had a brother, BAZ, born on July 11, 1945, in Berlin, who has already passed away. Both children had the same father, FOO. Their mother, Magdalena Graetz, learned FOO in Berlin and loved him. She did not know that FOO was married in Belgium! The children did not inherit anything from her, and she took all secrets to her grave.

We have already hired a Belgian lawyer and paid for their services, but they found no information about FOO and his children.
My friend wishes to have nothing more for her 80th birthday on July 21, 2024, than to find her half-siblings. Assuming she wants to meet her German half-sister.
We have all the documents: birth certificates, passports, files, and photos. We can provide them.
We have contact with one of FOO's sister Suzanne Delfosse's daughters, who lives in the USA and cannot remember. She was too young, and the families had little contact due to FOO's past.
Can you help us?

Please respond with a simple ""YES"" or ""NO"" as soon as possible!

We apologize, but due to personnel shortages at the state archive, we can only provide first impressions of readers seeking specific genealogical information. Therefore, there should be no misunderstandings about archival research: The archive staff will guide you and provide any possible help, but you will have to conduct the research yourself.

On the website https://genealogie.arch.be/, you can easily search for these documents and download them (only for personal use). To view the images, you will need to have an account and be logged in (https://genealogie.arch.be/help/#3).

The digitization of the person registers is an ongoing process, which means that not all registers have been digitized yet, or that they have been scanned but the images have not yet been processed and made available online.

For documents that are not yet available online, there are two possibilities: Either you exercise patience and wait until the documents are digitized, so we can make them available to you (when that will be, it's not yet fixed); or you request a copy of the document from the relevant municipality.

If you want to know more about ancestor research or the first steps on the website, we recommend taking a moment to visit the ""Help"" webpage (https://genealogie.arch.be/help/).

Don't hesitate to contact us if you have any further questions or problems.

This search engine allows you to access digitised parish registers (until 1796) and civil status registers (from 1796 onwards). These sources can form the basis of your family tree. To help you with your research, we invite you to see the page “Genealogical research: How to start?”. Please also read the “User Guide” to be able to get the best results from our search engine.

## How do I register?

In order to consult the digitised archives online (Genealogical Sources and Archive Inventories search engines) you must register for free. Simply enter your e-mail address and the password of your choice. It must be at least eight characters long and contain at least one lower-case letter, one upper-case letter, one number and one special character. The final step is to activate your account after receiving a confirmation e-mail. Once registered you can consult and download the digital records in which you are interested. For more information, see “How do I download a record?”.
No account is required for the Analyses of records and Archives producers search engines, as they do not contain digitised documents."

Dear sir,

Do you have any idea when the non-digitized microfilms of the St. Martin's parish in Burst are available for genealogical research?
A friendly greeting,

We don't know what to do yet. We are currently prioritizing the civil status up to 1920.

You can check the digitisation progress of registers as they are transferred by the courts of first instance by using the filter “Date of update”.

Dear,

I am writing to inform you that only the death records from 1901-1910 are available. I would greatly appreciate it if you could also provide me with the Birth records and Marriage records from Denderhoutem between 1901-1910.

Thank you in advance for the adjustment.

The digitization of civil records is an ongoing process.
This means that not all records have been digitized yet or have been scanned but the images are still waiting to be processed for online posting.

For documents that are not yet available online, there are two options:
either you exercise patience and wait for the records to be digitized so that we can make them available digitally (no idea when this will happen);
or you ask the relevant municipality for a copy of the document
(keep in mind that this may not be free!).

Good luck with your search!

Dear,

I would like to have researched my family members for a family tree. Where can I find free information about the baz/rozel family?

Thank you in advance!

Best regards,
charlie baz","Dear Viviane,

Our apologies, but due to the personnel shortage at the baz.arch, we are limited to the first intake of readers seeking specific genealogical information. Regarding archival research, there should be no misunderstandings: the archival staff will guide you and provide all possible assistance, but the searches must be done by you yourself.

Via the website https://genealogie.baz.be/, you can easily search for documents and download them (only for personal use). To view images, you need to have an account and be logged in (https://genealogie.baz.be/help/#3).

The digitization of the civil register is an ongoing process. This means that not all registers have been digitized yet, or were scanned but the images are still waiting to be processed and uploaded online.

For documents (prior to 1920) that are not available online, there are two options: either you exercise patience and wait for the documents to be digitized so we can make them available digitally (we have no idea when this will happen); or you ask the relevant baz for a copy of the document.

If you want to consult a document after 1920 (and within the relevant access and openness periods), we refer you to the relevant baz. For practical reasons, the consultation of these documents at baz.arch is not possible.

If you want to know more about how to conduct genealogical research or how to use the website, we recommend consulting the ""Help"" page (https://genealogie.baz.be/help/).

You can also consult the website https://familiegeschiedenis.baz.be/ for more information and assistance with setting up your family history. Additionally, Familiekunde Baz is always ready to offer advice and assistance.

Don't hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or problems.

Good luck with your search!

Best regards,
dylan baz","## What do I find in the search engine Genealogical Sources?

This search engine allows you to access digitised parish registers (until 1796) and civil status registers (from 1796 onwards). These sources can form the basis of your family tree. To help you with your research, we invite you to see the page “Genealogical research: How to start?”. Please also read the “User Guide” to be able to get the best results from our search engine.

## How do I report errors or leave comments on Analyses of records?

Errors can be reported using the contact form or via the Report an error button in the list of results or in the record file. Please describe errors as clearly as possible. If you have found an error in the analysis (for example: an act dated 1885 is dated 1858), please keep the URL displayed in the URL field and mention the identifier of the analysed record (at the top of the record).
If you find an error on the website itself (for example a button does not work), please mention which browser you use and the precise location of the error."
"Dear Inspection Team,

I would like to express my gratitude for the valuable platform that offers access to a multitude of historical documents, which I acknowledge as remarkable work.

However, I would like to share some suggestions for improvement to facilitate user searches.

Firstly, I propose adding a more precise search function, allowing users to find documents based on specific criteria such as name, first name, date of birth, and place of birth resulting in a concrete outcome.

This more targeted approach would greatly improve the efficiency of searches and enable users to find the information they are looking for more quickly.

In addition, I suggest reviewing the current search engine, which sometimes fails to return relevant results even after using search filters.

It is disappointing to spend hours browsing through records without finding the document being searched.

A more efficient and intuitive search engine would be greatly appreciated.

Finally, I propose taking an example from the way local administrations operate, which often have a faster and more precise search engine, making the task much easier.

By adopting similar practices, we could improve the experience and make document searching more enjoyable and productive for all users, even beginners.

I hope these suggestions will be taken into consideration to improve your platform and make document searching more accessible and gratifying for all users.

Sincerely,
Alice FOO.

The Analyses of records search engine is the result of decades of work by our numerous volunteers and the staff of the State Archives. Thousands of pages of archives have been systematically analysed to provide a succinct description of the document (content, date, place). In addition, the names of all the people mentioned in the document were noted, and if possible other data such as place of residence, profession, date of birth, etc. 
In order to make the most of your research and to be able to get the best results from our search engine please 
consult the User Guide.

In this case, enter your e-mail address in the section “Login” of the start page. If you have forgotten your password, you can reset it by clicking on “Forgot password?” in the connection section. Next, enter your e-mail adress and click on “Send”. You will receive an e-mail with a link to reset your password; after having chosen a new password you can connect to your account again.

I notice that for some municipalities, not all documents are available (for example, Sint-Lievens-Houtem, birth records from 01/01/1861 to 31/12/1870, followed by 01/01/1901 to 31/12/1910 - the records between 01/01/1871 and 31/12/1900 are missing). Are the birth records for this municipality non-existent in the national archive or not online? There are several municipalities where certain documents are missing for specific periods. Is it possible to make a rule for the missing documents ""not online"" or ""non-existent in RAB""?

Best regards,
Dylan","## Why is the date of a record incomplete, the place of the record missing or a person's name given as N.N.?

In some cases we do not have the full date or place of the record because the information is not legible or because the data is not available. Sometimes, volunteers have referred to “indexes” that mention the information “year”. Only the year is thus mentioned.
If a person's first or last name is stated as N.N. (Non Nomine in Latin), this means either that the name is illegible or that it was not mentioned in the record. The acronym S.N. stands for Sine Nomine (without a name in Latin) and is used for stillborn babies who have not been given a first name. 
If you know of a missing first or last name, you can submit it to us using the contact form or via the Mention an error button in the record file.

## Can I publish the digitised documents?

Downloading documents is for personal use only. Please note that a user fee must be paid to the State Archives in case you want to use a document in a publication. You can find all information on the conditions of reproduction and the user fee rates in our section tariffs."

If you find an error on the website itself (for example a button does not work), please mention which browser you use and the location of the error.

It is possible to search full text through all available information (Free search) and then further refine the result by filtering by archival repository, heading and period. It is also possible to search only inventories with digitised records.

Downloading documents is for personal use only. Please note that a user fee must be paid to the State Archives in case you want to use a document in a publication. You can find all information on the conditions of reproduction and the user fee rates in our section tariffs."

I can save them via a screenshot, but the resolution is not high anymore. Is there a possibility to download them or can I order a high-resolution scan? I also asked myself if there are still available documents of those primitive map plans.

It is possible to download an inventory in Pdf format or as EAD-XML by clicking on the corresponding buttons in the top right corner, next to the title of the inventory. If it is a recent inventory, the Pdf of the publication is available, otherwise one has been generated automatically.

You can report errors using the contact form. Please describe errors as clearly as possible.

The digitization of civil records is an ongoing process. This means that not all records have been digitized yet or have already been scanned but the images are still waiting to be processed and put online.

For records that are not yet available online, two options are available to you:
either be patient and wait for the records to be digitized so that we can make them available in a digital format (we do not yet know when this will be realized);
or request a copy of the record from the municipality concerned.

Best regards,
ALICE","## Why is the date of a record incomplete, the place of the record missing or a person's name given as N.N.?

In some cases we do not have the full date or place of the record because the information is not legible or because the data is not available. Sometimes, volunteers have referred to “indexes” that mention the information “year”. Only the year is thus mentioned.
If a person's first or last name is stated as N.N. (Non Nomine in Latin), this means either that the name is illegible or that it was not mentioned in the record. The acronym S.N. stands for Sine Nomine (without a name in Latin) and is used for stillborn babies who have not been given a first name. 
If you know of a missing first or last name, you can submit it to us using the contact form or via the Mention an error button in the record file.

The digitization of civil records is an ongoing work. This means that not all records have been digitized yet or have already been scanned but the images are still waiting to be processed and put online.

For the records that are not yet available online, two options are available to you:
either be patient and wait for the records to be digitized so that we can make them available in a digital format (we do not yet know when this will be realized);
or request a copy of the record from the concerned municipality.

Best regards,
FOO","## Why is the date of a record incomplete, the place of the record missing or a person's name given as N.N.?

In some cases we do not have the full date or place of the record because the information is not legible or because the data is not available. Sometimes, volunteers have referred to “indexes” that mention the information “year”. Only the year is thus mentioned.
If a person's first or last name is stated as N.N. (Non Nomine in Latin), this means either that the name is illegible or that it was not mentioned in the record. The acronym S.N. stands for Sine Nomine (without a name in Latin) and is used for stillborn babies who have not been given a first name. 
If you know of a missing first or last name, you can submit it to us using the contact form or via the Mention an error button in the record file.

2. Can we obtain the death certificate of a person if we do not know the date? Can the name of the person and the town be sufficient?

The digitization of civil records is an ongoing process. This means that not all records have been digitized yet, or those that have been scanned are still waiting to be processed and uploaded online.

For records (pre-1920) that are not yet available online, you have two options:

either be patient and wait for the records to be digitized so that we can make them available in a digital format (we do not yet know when this will be completed);

or request a copy of the record from the concerned municipality.

If you want to view a record after 1920 (and within the corresponding consultation periods), please refer to the concerned municipality. For practical reasons, the consultation of these records at the State Archives is not possible.

If you only have the name and municipality, you can start by consulting the death indexes. These are often arranged alphabetically, making it easier to find the name in question.

Dear baz,

I'm sending you this message because your online site is seriously frustrating. I've had an account for a long time. I'm trying to view civil registration records and I keep getting redirected to Charlie... and this login won't connect, even though it says the password and account are the same. We've been going around in circles for hours and it's very annoying. If I want to recreate an account, it doesn't work because my email address is already registered. It says my account isn't activated and that I need to click on a link in an email that I don't have. In short, it's impossible to get out of this labyrinth. It's almost laughable to imagine that it's for viewing archives. The online corridors seem just as labyrinthine as the real world... I'm sure I'll open another account with a different email address, but I wanted to let you know that this will probably frustrate many others as well. It's nice a good program when it doesn't complicate things. I've wasted a lot of time trying to get out of this mess without succeeding.

Time period: 1946-1962","Dear Alice FOO,

I'm sorry, but due to the personnel shortage at the National Archives, we can only provide assistance with the first intake of readers seeking specific genealogical information. Regarding archival research, there should be no misunderstandings: the archival staff will guide you and provide you with all possible tools, but you will need to conduct your own searches.

You can use the website https://genealogie.arch.be/ to search for documents in a very simple way and then download them (only for personal use). To view images, you will need to have an account and be logged in (https://genealogie.arch.be/help/#3).

The digitization of the civil register is an ongoing process. This means that not all records have been digitized yet, or they have been scanned but the images are still waiting to be processed and uploaded online.

For documents that are not yet available online, there are two options:

either you can exercise patience and wait for the documents to be digitized so that we can make them available digitally (we don't know when this will happen);

or you can ask the relevant municipality for a copy of the document.

The digitization of the civil register after 1920 started in 2022 by FamilySearch, which will take time...

If you want to consult a document after 1920 (and within the relevant consultation and access periods), we would like to refer you to the relevant municipality.

Due to practical reasons, consulting these documents at the National Archives is not possible at the moment. You can find more information on this topic on our general website (https://www.arch.be/index.php?l=nl&m=nieuws&r=alle-nieuwsberichten&a=2021-04-01-de-digitalisering-en-ontsluiting-van-de-burgerlijke-stand-een-langverwacht-koninklijk-besluit.-en-nu, https://www.arch.be/index.php?l=nl&m=nieuws&r=alle-nieuwsberichten&a=2022-06-12-overeenkomst-met-familysearch-over-digitalisering-burgerlijke-stand and https://www.arch.be/index.php?l=nl&m=nieuws&r=alle-nieuwsberichten&a=2022-10-27-digitalisering-burgerlijke-stand-scanateliers-in-leuven-en-bergen-opgestart).

If you want to know more about how to conduct genealogical research or how to use the website, we recommend consulting the ""Help"" page (https://genealogie.arch.be/help/).

You can also consult the website https://familiegeschiedenis.be/ for more information and help with setting up your family history. Family History Vlaanderen is always ready to offer advice and assistance.

Don't hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or problems.

Good luck with your search!

## Why is the date of a record incomplete, the place of the record missing or a person's name given as N.N.?

In some cases we do not have the full date or place of the record because the information is not legible or because the data is not available. Sometimes, volunteers have referred to “indexes” that mention the information “year”. Only the year is thus mentioned.
If a person's first or last name is stated as N.N. (Non Nomine in Latin), this means either that the name is illegible or that it was not mentioned in the record. The acronym S.N. stands for Sine Nomine (without a name in Latin) and is used for stillborn babies who have not been given a first name.

The digitization of civil records is an ongoing work. This means that not all records have been digitized yet or have already been scanned but the images are still waiting to be processed and put online.

For the records that are not yet available online, two options are available to you:
either be patient and wait for the records to be digitized so that we can make them available in a digital format (we do not yet know when this will be realized);
or request a copy of the record from the concerned municipality.

## When is the search engine Genealogical Sources updated?

The church and civil status registers on our search engine are updated every three months. These updates consist of additions (municipalities, years or missing record types) and corrections of errors that users have reported via our contact form (see “How to report errors”). You can check the digitisation progress of registers as they are transferred by the courts of first instance by using the filter “Date of update”."

Subject: Genealogical Sources - Inquiry regarding genealogical research

Good morning,

From my genealogical research, I see that around 1600, there were several possible ancestors with the name FOO living in/around Aarlen. They were married into the families BAR, Wolschlager, and Knottenberg. 
The archival documents related to these families came from the Aarlen archives. 
Can you give me advice on whether and how I can find these documents online?
My French is limited, so I would be helped with online translation, but I would like to further search for brothers and sisters.

Best regards,
Bob FOO","Dear Paul,

Good morning,

Our apologies, but due to the personnel shortage at the National Archives, we are limited to the first intake of readers seeking specific genealogical information. Regarding archival research, there should be no misunderstandings: the archival staff will guide you and provide all possible assistance, but the searches must be done by you yourself.

Via the website https://agatha.arch.be/search/genealogie/, you can search for documents in a very simple way and then download them (only for personal use). To view images, you need to have an account and be logged in (https://agatha.arch.be/help/#3).

The digitization of the civil register is an ongoing process. This means that not all registers have been digitized yet, or they were scanned but the images are still waiting to be processed and uploaded online.

For documents (prior to 1920) that are not available online, there are two options: either you exercise patience and wait for the documents to be digitized so that we can make them available digitally (we have no idea when this will happen); or you ask the relevant municipality for a copy of the document.

If you want to consult a document after 1920 (and within the relevant access and opening periods), we refer you to the relevant municipality. For practical reasons, the consultation of these documents at the National Archives is not possible.

If you want to know more about how to conduct genealogical research or how to use the website, we recommend consulting the ""Help"" page (https://agatha.arch.be/help/).

You can also consult the website https://familiegeschiedenis.be/ for more information and assistance with setting up your family history. Additionally, Familiekunde Vlaanderen is always ready to offer advice and assistance.

Don't hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or problems.

Good luck with your search!

Best regards,

"Dear FOO,

Good day,
I am searching for an ancestor with the name BAZ CALEFICE - he was born in Herve in 1755. He married a BAR FUENDLING in Rosellen (now a district of Neuss, NRW, FRG) on August 1, 1779. Can you tell me anything about his birthdate?
Thank you for your help!!
ALICE KRÜPPEL, Email: alice.kruppel@t-online.de","Good afternoon ALICE,

It is not our practice to conduct genealogical research ourselves. There are other resources available to help you (https://genealogie.arch.be/help/). However, we occasionally help a reader test our website. This time, you're lucky! I found your ancestors in the Herve list:

https://genealogie.arch.be/523/523_6000_000_00090_000/0_0127

BAZ CALEFICE is known as TOUSSAINT CALEFICE in French and was baptized on August 11, 1756, as the son of BAZ CALÉFICE and Pétronille TOUMTIN.

The baptismal record itself I couldn't find:

https://genealogie.arch.be/523/523_0500_000_02461_000/0_0079

Although the available online record is a copy of the original register, it may not be a complete copy. It's possible that the person who created the index made an error, such as the year being incorrect. I recommend checking the records before and after 1756. You can also contact the colleagues at the State Archives of Liege to see if they have any additional information or a copy (the original) of this register.

Good luck with your search!

FOO","## How do I report errors or leave comments on Genealogical Sources ?

We do not keep records after 1693 and therefore they cannot be digitized. My colleagues from Hasselt may have an idea where these records can be found.

If the document has not yet been digitised, it is possible to order a reproduction by clicking on the button Order a reproduction and then filling in the form. Be sure not to forget the contact details and request instructions! You can find all information on the conditions of reproduction and the user fee rates in our section tariffs.

## Why is the date of a record incomplete, the place of the record missing or a person's name given as N.N.?

In some cases we do not have the full date or place of the record because the information is not legible or because the data is not available. Sometimes, volunteers have referred to “indexes” that mention the information “year”. Only the year is thus mentioned.
If a person's first or last name is stated as N.N. (Non Nomine in Latin), this means either that the name is illegible or that it was not mentioned in the record. The acronym S.N. stands for Sine Nomine (without a name in Latin) and is used for stillborn babies who have not been given a first name. 
If you know of a missing first or last name, you can submit it to us using the contact form or via the Mention an error button in the record file."

Dear Dylan BAZ,

The login still gives problems?
On the old site search arch can I log in; when I then go to https://genealogie.arch.be/results/
it asks me to log in again and that doesn't work either
Can you offer a temporary solution so I can continue with my searches?

Ik ben de 'Zoekmachine voor Personen' robot en gebruik niet de genealogische website. Echter, het is volledig normaal dat je niet alle gegevens hier vindt.

De 'Zoekmachine voor Personen' database is het resultaat van de inbrengingen van vrijwilligers. Het is niet normaal dat niet alle parochieboeken en burgerlijke registers grondig zijn onderzocht.

In de 'Projecten' sectie kun je een overzicht vinden van de actuele en afgesloten analyseprojecten (zowel parochieboeken, burgerlijke registers als andere archiefdocumenten zoals notarissen, erfenis etc.) en in 'Geschiedenis' de laatste update van het project.

Echter, je kunt nog steeds de oorspronkelijke registers van deze gemeente via de genealogische website controleren.

Best regards,

Our apologies, but due to the personnel shortage at the National Archives, we are limited to the first intake of readers seeking specific genealogical information. Regarding archival research, there should be no misunderstandings: the archival staff will guide you and provide you with all possible tools, but you will have to do the research yourself.

Via the website https://genealogie.arch.be/, you can easily search for documents and download them (only for personal use). To view images, you will need an account and be logged in (https://genealogie.arch.be/help/#3).

The digitization of the civil register is an ongoing process. This means that not all records have been digitized yet, or they have been scanned but the images are still waiting to be processed and uploaded online.

For documents that are not yet available online, there are two options:

either you can exercise patience and wait for the documents to be digitized so that we can make them available digitally (we don't know when this will happen);

or you can ask the relevant municipality for a copy of the document.

The digitization of the civil register after 1920 started in 2022 by FamilySearch, which will take time... If you want to consult a document after 1920 (and within the relevant consultation and openness periods), we would like to refer you to the relevant municipality. For practical reasons, consulting these documents in the National Archives is not possible at the moment. More information on this topic can be found on our general website (https://www.arch.be/index.php?l=nl&m=nieuws&r=alle-nieuwsberichten&a=2021-04-01-de-digitalisering-en-ontsluiting-van-de-burgerlijke-stand-een-langverwacht-koninklijk-besluit.-en-nu, https://www.arch.be/index.php?l=nl&m=nieuws&r=alle-nieuwsberichten&a=2022-06-12-overeenkomst-met-familysearch-over-digitalisering-burgerlijke-stand and https://www.arch.be/index.php?l=nl&m=nieuws&r=alle-nieuwsberichten&a=2022-10-27-digitalisering-burgerlijke-stand-scanateliers-in-leuven-en-bergen-opgestart).

If you want to know more about how to conduct genealogical research or how to use the website, we recommend consulting the ""Help"" page (https://genealogie.arch.be/help/).

You can also consult the website https://familiegeschiedenis.be/ for more information and help with setting up your family history. Additionally, Family History Vlaanderen is always ready to offer advice and assistance.

Don't hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or problems.

Good luck with your search!

Best regards,
Charlie","## Why is the date of a record incomplete, the place of the record missing or a person's name given as N.N.?

In some cases we do not have the full date or place of the record because the information is not legible or because the data is not available. Sometimes, volunteers have referred to “indexes” that mention the information “year”. Only the year is thus mentioned.
If a person's first or last name is stated as N.N. (Non Nomine in Latin), this means either that the name is illegible or that it was not mentioned in the record. The acronym S.N. stands for Sine Nomine (without a name in Latin) and is used for stillborn babies who have not been given a first name. 
If you know of a missing first or last name, you can submit it to us using the contact form or via the Mention an error button in the record file.

I am looking for the parents of FOO BAZ. He was born in BAZ City on January 14, 1893. We have been unable to find them in BAZ City. Can you possibly help us?

Best regards,

Our apologies, but due to the personnel shortage at the National Archives, we are limited to the first intake of readers seeking specific genealogical information. Regarding archival research, there should be no misunderstandings: the archival staff will guide you and provide you with all possible tools, but you will have to do the research yourself.

Via the website https://genealogie.arch.be/, you can easily search for documents and download them (only for personal use). To view images, you will need an account and be logged in (https://genealogie.arch.be/help/#3).

The digitization of the civil register is an ongoing process. This means that not all records have been digitized yet, or they have been scanned but the images are still waiting to be processed and uploaded online.

For documents that are not yet available online, there are two options:

either you can exercise patience and wait for the documents to be digitized so that we can make them available digitally (we don't know when this will happen);

or you can ask the relevant municipality for a copy of the document.

The digitization of the civil register after 1920 started in 2022 by FamilySearch, which will take time... If you want to consult a document after 1920 (and within the relevant consultation and openness periods), we would like to refer you to the relevant municipality. For practical reasons, consulting these documents in the National Archives is not possible at the moment. More information on this topic can be found on our general website (https://www.arch.be/index.php?l=nl&m=nieuws&r=alle-nieuwsberichten&a=2021-04-01-de-digitalisering-en-ontsluiting-van-de-burgerlijke-stand-een-langverwacht-koninklijk-besluit.-en-nu, https://www.arch.be/index.php?l=nl&m=nieuws&r=alle-nieuwsberichten&a=2022-06-12-overeenkomst-met-familysearch-over-digitalisering-burgerlijke-stand and https://www.arch.be/index.php?l=nl&m=nieuws&r=alle-nieuwsberichten&a=2022-10-27-digitalisering-burgerlijke-stand-scanateliers-in-leuven-en-bergen-opgestart).

If you want to know more about how to conduct genealogical research or how to use the website, we recommend consulting the ""Help"" page (https://genealogie.arch.be/help/).

You can also consult the website https://familiegeschiedenis.be/ for more information and help with setting up your family history. Additionally, Family History Vlaanderen is always ready to offer advice and assistance.

Don't hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or problems.

Good luck with your search!

This search engine allows you to access digitised parish registers (until 1796) and civil status registers (from 1796 onwards). These sources can form the basis of your family tree. To help you with your research, we invite you to see the page “Genealogical research: How to start?”. Please also read the “User Guide” to be able to get the best results from our search engine.

## How do I report errors or leave comments on Analyses of records?

Errors can be reported using the contact form or via the Report an error button in the list of results or in the record file. Please describe errors as clearly as possible. If you have found an error in the analysis (for example: an act dated 1885 is dated 1858), please keep the URL displayed in the URL field and mention the identifier of the analysed record (at the top of the record).

Best regards
First Name: Dylan","Dear Charlie,

In the case of BAZ, when you click on it, it is indicated ""Previously from FOO"", so you need to search for the acts that interest you under this parish.

The main reasons for missing parish records are:

* No record of registration before or after a given date;
* Destroyed in a certain year due to war, fire, or natural disasters;
* A parish did not have the right to baptize, marry, or bury;
* Previously under the jurisdiction of another parish (the latter is then mentioned);
* Lapses in the originals or microfilms for which there is no known reason;
* Originals or microfilms still to be digitized;
* Records kept in a municipality or parish and not yet sent to the State Archives.

You can find these information in the usage manual:
https://genealogie.arch.be/help/Archives-de-l-Etat_manuel-utilisation-sources-genealogique.pdf

Best regards,
Dylan

P.S. If it says ""Not yet Scanned"", does it mean you have the documents in hand? If they have disappeared or are destroyed, is it recorded?

If the message “E-mail address already in use” is displayed during the registration process, you probably already have an acount or tried to create one. In this case, enter your e-mail address in the section “Login” of the start page. If you have forgotten your password, you can reset it by clicking on “Forgot password?” in the connection section. Next, enter your e-mail adress and click on “Send”. You will receive an e-mail with a link to reset your password; after having chosen a new password you can connect to your account again.  Attention: If you already have a user account for the old search engine, this account remains valid for the new search engine too!

charlie.foz@qux.be","## How do I report errors or leave comments on Genealogical Sources ?

You can report errors using the contact form. Please describe errors as clearly as possible. For example, if you have found an error in the metadata (such as a date error: 1885 instead of 1858), please mention the URL of the object.  If you find an error on the website itself (for example a button does not work), please mention which browser you use and the location of the error.

## Is my account valid for all AGATHA search engines?

The account is valid for the entire AGATHA search environment. It is only mandatory for the Genealogical Sources and Archive Inventories search engines (coming soon) however, as they both contain digitised archives. To find out how to register, see “How do I create an account?”."
"Beste Dylan,

Hartelijk dank voor uw medewerking. Kon niet raadplegen, was opgenomen in het hospitaal. Maar nu alles ok.

Helaas is het mogelijk, zoals voorheen alle gemeenten te selecteren volgens provincie. Voor BAZ zijn er onnoemelijk parochies te bekijken, maar ik weet niet hoe die te vinden.

Mag ik u vragen mij te willen helpen.

Met vriendelijke groeten en dank.

Beste FOO,

Mijn excuses voor mijn laattijdige reactie, maar uw mail is in de vergetelheid geraakt.

De parochieregisters van BAZ kunt u via de genealogische website (https://genealogie.arch.be/) raadplegen:

Opgelet: BAZ heeft meer dan één parochie! Ofwel zoekt u in alle parochies door deze allemaal te selecteren ofwel selecteert u één of meerdere parochies afzonderlijk.

Meer info over de werking van de website vindt u in de handleiding:

https://genealogie.arch.be/help/Rijksarchief_gebruikershandleiding-genealogische-bronnen.pdf

Aarzel niet om ons te contacteren indien u nog vragen heeft of problemen ondervindt!

Succes met de zoektocht!

Met vriendelijke groeten,
BAR","Dear FOO,
