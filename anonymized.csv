## How do I report errors or leave comments on Analyses of records?

Errors can be reported using the contact form or via the Report an error button in the list of results or in the record file. Please describe errors as clearly as possible. If you have found an error in the analysis (for example: an act dated 1885 is dated 1858), please keep the URL displayed in the URL field and mention the identifier of the analysed record (at the top of the record).
If you find an error on the website itself (for example a button does not work), please mention which browser you use and the precise location of the error."

I am writing to request a copy of the marriage certificate of Alice FOO and BAR BAZ, married in Neerpelt (St. Niklaas) on January 8, 1787.

Please let me know if this is possible.

Sincerely,
Charlie Dylan","Dear Charlie,

We do not keep records after 1693 and therefore they cannot be digitized. My colleagues from Hasselt may have an idea where these records can be found.

Best regards,
Dylan FOO","## How do I request a copy of an original?

If the document has not yet been digitised, it is possible to order a reproduction by clicking on the button Order a reproduction and then filling in the form. Be sure not to forget the contact details and request instructions! You can find all information on the conditions of reproduction and the user fee rates in our section tariffs.

## Why is the date of a record incomplete, the place of the record missing or a person's name given as N.N.?

In some cases we do not have the full date or place of the record because the information is not legible or because the data is not available. Sometimes, volunteers have referred to “indexes” that mention the information “year”. Only the year is thus mentioned.
If a person's first or last name is stated as N.N. (Non Nomine in Latin), this means either that the name is illegible or that it was not mentioned in the record. The acronym S.N. stands for Sine Nomine (without a name in Latin) and is used for stillborn babies who have not been given a first name. 
If you know of a missing first or last name, you can submit it to us using the contact form or via the Mention an error button in the record file."

How can I consult parish records?
I am looking for baptismal records of charlie henricus simons, born 04/11/1900, birth record number 6908, who lived at katelijnevest 6 in antwerp, so I suspect the baz parish.
Please explain how i can consult these parish records and how to search them.

The parish registers after 1796 are not digitized and are located in the National Archives (to which the parish is affiliated), available at the municipality or church office.

The parish archive of baz's antwerp is not stored in the National Archives. Please therefore contact the current church office/priest with regards to this.

If the message “E-mail address already in use” is displayed during the registration process, you probably already have an acount or tried to create one. In this case, enter your e-mail address in the section “Login” of the start page. If you have forgotten your password, you can reset it by clicking on “Forgot password?” in the connection section. Next, enter your e-mail adress and click on “Send”. You will receive an e-mail with a link to reset your password; after having chosen a new password you can connect to your account again.

## Why do the links of the old search engine no longer work?

Unfortunately, some links of the old search engine were not permalinks (see “What is a permalink?”) which is why they could not be connected to the new search engine. So via the church and civil status registers you can find back the links to records you have previously saved."

## Why is the date of a record incomplete, the place of the record missing or a person's name given as N.N.?

In some cases we do not have the full date or place of the record because the information is not legible or because the data is not available. Sometimes, volunteers have referred to “indexes” that mention the information “year”. Only the year is thus mentioned.
If a person's first or last name is stated as N.N. (Non Nomine in Latin), this means either that the name is illegible or that it was not mentioned in the record. The acronym S.N. stands for Sine Nomine (without a name in Latin) and is used for stillborn babies who have not been given a first name.

Dear Sir/Madam,

Recently, I was informed about the online availability of (other) parish records at the Belgian National Archives. I would like to compliment you on this.

I am searching for information from these records regarding the period 1750-1770 from the place Namur/Namur. One of my ancestors was stationed militarily in this period in Namur. I have already consulted the records. I have understood that due to various circumstances (war; fire) not all documents are available.

Is there an explanation or description of the parish records available that would indicate which ones are still available or have been lost?

RE: BAZ BAR

Hello,

I am looking for information about my grandfather BAZ BAR who was taken during World War II.

In my search, I received information that he died in Flossenburg. However, my question is now, where, when, and why was he taken, was he with the resistance or whatever I can find out.

He lived in Snellegem (as far as I know) and was born on February 6, 1920, and died in Flossenburg, subcamp Mockethal-Zatzschke on April 15, 1945.

Perhaps I am wrong with my question, but if so, it is possible to inform me where I can find further information.

The digitization of civil records is an ongoing process.
This means that not all records have been digitized yet or have been scanned but the images are still waiting for processing to be uploaded online.

For documents that are not yet available online, there are two options:
either you exercise patience and wait for the records to be digitized so that we can make them available digitally (no idea when this will happen);
or you ask the relevant municipality for a copy of the document.

Dear baz,

I am writing to inquire about genealogical sources regarding my research.

On October 25, 1889, my great-grandparents foo bar and baz baz (registration number 1500) got married. At least two daughters were born from this marriage. I do not know their names or birth dates.

How can I quickly find this information in the archives? I have a photo from 1925, and the girls were quite large back then.

Baz is the sister of my grandfather.

Can you help me?

Thank you in advance.

Sincerely,
dylan baz,

Dear Wim,

The easiest thing is to consult the indices of the municipality where the couple got married, and therefore check all the births with the surname baz (the birth dates are probably after the marriage year, so 1889). One indexer mentioned the names of the parents, and you're lucky 😊, the other did not, and then there's nothing else to do but to look up the deed to find out who the parents were.

In some cases we do not have the full date or place of the record because the information is not legible or because the data is not available. Sometimes, volunteers have referred to “indexes” that mention the information “year”. Only the year is thus mentioned.
If a person's first or last name is stated as N.N. (Non Nomine in Latin), this means either that the name is illegible or that it was not mentioned in the record.

I am having trouble finding the marriage records for the years 1888 to 1890 for the WOLVERTEM municipality administration.

Can you please tell me what is the issue?

Thank you in advance
BAR","Dear Alice,

The digitization of civil records is an ongoing work. This means that not all records have been digitized yet or have already been scanned but the images are still waiting to be processed and put online.

For the records that are not yet available online, two options are available to you:
either be patient and wait for the records to be digitized so that we can make them available in a digital format (we do not yet know when this will be realized);
or request a copy of the record from the concerned municipality.

Best regards,
BAZ","## Why is the date of a record incomplete, the place of the record missing or a person's name given as N.N.?

In some cases we do not have the full date or place of the record because the information is not legible or because the data is not available. Sometimes, volunteers have referred to “indexes” that mention the information “year”. Only the year is thus mentioned.
If a person's first or last name is stated as N.N. (Non Nomine in Latin), this means either that the name is illegible or that it was not mentioned in the record. The acronym S.N. stands for Sine Nomine (without a name in Latin) and is used for stillborn babies who have not been given a first name. 
If you know of a missing first or last name, you can submit it to us using the contact form or via the Mention an error button in the record file.

## How to search in Archive inventories?

It is possible to search full text through all available information (Free search) and then further refine the result by filtering by archival repository, heading and period. It is also possible to search only inventories with digitised records.
Attention: you search in the descriptions of the documents and not in the content of the records!"

The church and civil status registers on our search engine are updated every three months. These updates consist of additions (municipalities, years or missing record types) and corrections of errors that users have reported via our contact form (see “How to report errors”).

If the message “E-mail address already in use” is displayed during the registration process, you probably already have an acount or tried to create one. In this case, enter your e-mail address in the section “Login” of the start page. If you have forgotten your password, you can reset it by clicking on “Forgot password?” in the connection section. Next, enter your e-mail adress and click on “Send”. You will receive an e-mail with a link to reset your password; after having chosen a new password you can connect to your account again.  Attention: If you already have a user account for the old search engine, this account remains valid for the new search engine too!

## Why do the links of the old search engine no longer work?

Unfortunately, some links of the old search engine were not permalinks (see “What is a permalink?”) which is why they could not be connected to the new search engine. So via the church and civil status registers you can find back the links to records you have previously saved."

## Why is the date of a record incomplete, the place of the record missing or a person's name given as N.N.?

In some cases we do not have the full date or place of the record because the information is not legible or because the data is not available. Sometimes, volunteers have referred to “indexes” that mention the information “year”. Only the year is thus mentioned.
If a person's first or last name is stated as N.N. (Non Nomine in Latin), this means either that the name is illegible or that it was not mentioned in the record. The acronym S.N. stands for Sine Nomine (without a name in Latin) and is used for stillborn babies who have not been given a first name.

How can I register?

We have activated your account manually. You can log in with your username or email address. If you forget your password, you can reset it by clicking on 'Forgot Password'. 

We recommend changing your password when you log in for the first time and this will prevent any future problems (note: the old password for the search robot has also been changed!).

You can report errors using the contact form. Please describe errors as clearly as possible. For example, if you have found an error in the metadata (such as a date error: 1885 instead of 1858), please mention the URL of the object.  If you find an error on the website itself (for example a button does not work), please mention which browser you use and the location of the error.

## How do I register?

In order to consult the digitised archives online (Genealogical Sources and Archive Inventories search engines) you must register for free. Simply enter your e-mail address and the password of your choice. It must be at least eight characters long and contain at least one lower-case letter, one upper-case letter, one number and one special character. The final step is to activate your account after receiving a confirmation e-mail. Once registered you can consult and download the digital records in which you are interested. For more information, see “How do I download a record?”.
No account is required for the Analyses of records and Archives producers search engines, as they do not contain digitised documents."

Dear,
I signed up a while ago because I started doing genealogy. I found the birth records of my great-aunts (born in Kalken and Heusden-Diest) then, but I no longer find the direct link to the archives of arrondissement Dendermonde on the page... The search on this page doesn't really help me either. I would greatly appreciate your help here, thank you. Best regards, Dylan","Here is the anonymized response:

Dear Charlie,

Since July 17, 2023, the old access to the digital parish registers and civil status records is no longer available. From now on, these sources can only be accessed via the genealogical website (https://genealogie.arch.be/).

You can optionally convert the old URLs to the new ones via the website https://arsfam.com/en/archbe-urls.

## Why is the date of a record incomplete, the place of the record missing or a person's name given as N.N.?

In some cases we do not have the full date or place of the record because the information is not legible or because the data is not available. Sometimes, volunteers have referred to “indexes” that mention the information “year”. Only the year is thus mentioned.
If a person's first or last name is stated as N.N. (Non Nomine in Latin), this means either that the name is illegible or that it was not mentioned in the record. The acronym S.N. stands for Sine Nomine (without a name in Latin) and is used for stillborn babies who have not been given a first name. 
If you know of a missing first or last name, you can submit it to us using the contact form or via the Mention an error button in the record file."

Downloading documents is for personal use only. Please note that a user fee must be paid to the State Archives in case you want to use a document in a publication. You can find all information on the conditions of reproduction and the user fee rates in our section tariffs.

## Why is the date of a record incomplete, the place of the record missing or a person's name given as N.N.?

In some cases we do not have the full date or place of the record because the information is not legible or because the data is not available. Sometimes, volunteers have referred to “indexes” that mention the information “year”. Only the year is thus mentioned.
If a person's first or last name is stated as N.N. (Non Nomine in Latin), this means either that the name is illegible or that it was not mentioned in the record. The acronym S.N. stands for Sine Nomine (without a name in Latin) and is used for stillborn babies who have not been given a first name.

Dear,

The death records of the municipality of BAZST prior to 1871 are not available. Two results are given for ""mixed records from 1833 to 1888"" but these are only exceptions and do not include birth, death, and marriage records. I previously consulted these (the old system) but can no longer find them. The 10-year overviews still match. Can they not be consulted anymore or is there something wrong with them? Or can I consult them elsewhere? I would greatly appreciate any advice on how to do so.

Thank you for looking into this.

Hello,
This genealogical website is a welcome help in our family search.
Normally, records from over 100 years are freely accessible, but most municipalities/cities stop at 1910 to maybe a few until 1914, while we are already in 2024.
Vilvoorde, for example, ends at 1910.
Can records from 1910 to 1923 be expected to be available?
I look forward to the completion.

Genealogical sources - Beveren by Roeselare: unclear index for alphabetical index of baptism and birth records

Dear Charlie BAR,

I stumbled upon the following problem:

When searching for the alphabetical index of baptism and birth records for Beveren by Roeselare, one gets the following screen:

It appears that there are two parishes with different indices. However, when you open them, you get an identical index from page 1 to page 171 (i.e., from the same parish):

 

But the index of St. Germanus gives an additional alphabetical index from page 171 to page 178. I suspect that this alphabetical register collects the two parishes, but it is not clearly indicated in the summary index

Best regards,
Dylan BAZ","Here is the anonymized response:

Dear Dylan,

I have made the necessary adjustments to the database. The parish of Holy Cross Supplication replaced the Germanus parish from 1928. Therefore, all records and indexes are from the Germanus parish.

The adjustments will be visible with the next update of the website.

Hello

I am noticing a new degradation of response times on genealogy.arch.be. You explained the reason for these slow response times in your email of July 31, 2023. After that date, the procedure must have been modified because the response times were satisfactory again on August 7, 2023.

I am looking for any registration in the Civil Register of foo@motte and bar@crasborn who married on november 6, 1799, in the church of baz@mesch in the netherlands. foo@motte was supposed to have been living in the church register in baz@fouron in baz@comte, baz@gravenvoeren.

Kind regards, Dylan","Here is the anonymized response:

Dear Dylan,

The digitization of civil records is an ongoing process.
This means that not all records have been digitized yet or have been scanned but the images are still waiting for processing to be uploaded online.

For documents that are not yet available online, there are two options:
either you exercise patience and wait for the records to be digitized so that we can make them available digitally (no idea when this will happen);
or you ask the baz@fouron municipality for a copy of the document.
(Note: it may not be free!)

## Why is the date of a record incomplete, the place of the record missing or a person's name given as N.N.?

In some cases we do not have the full date or place of the record because the information is not legible or because the data is not available. Sometimes, volunteers have referred to “indexes” that mention the information “year”. Only the year is thus mentioned.
If a person's first or last name is stated as N.N. (Non Nomine in Latin), this means either that the name is illegible or that it was not mentioned in the record. The acronym S.N. stands for Sine Nomine (without a name in Latin) and is used for stillborn babies who have not been given a first name. 
If you know of a missing first or last name, you can submit it to us using the contact form or via the Mention an error button in the record file."

I hope you still have access to the genealogical website and images. According to our user database, this is still the case (last visit on 02/12).

You can perform multiple searches by opening multiple tabs in your browser. When you open the website in a new tab, you are automatically logged in.

## Why is the date of a record incomplete, the place of the record missing or a person's name given as N.N.?

In some cases we do not have the full date or place of the record because the information is not legible or because the data is not available. Sometimes, volunteers have referred to “indexes” that mention the information “year”. Only the year is thus mentioned.
If a person's first or last name is stated as N.N. (Non Nomine in Latin), this means either that the name is illegible or that it was not mentioned in the record. The acronym S.N. stands for Sine Nomine (without a name in Latin) and is used for stillborn babies who have not been given a first name. 
If you know of a missing first or last name, you can submit it to us using the contact form or via the Mention an error button in the record file."

If the message “E-mail address already in use” is displayed during the registration process, you probably already have an acount or tried to create one. In this case, enter your e-mail address in the section “Login” of the start page. If you have forgotten your password, you can reset it by clicking on “Forgot password?” in the connection section. Next, enter your e-mail adress and click on “Send”. You will receive an e-mail with a link to reset your password; after having chosen a new password you can connect to your account again.  Attention: If you already have a user account for the old search engine, this account remains valid for the new search engine too!

## When is the search engine Genealogical Sources updated?

The church and civil status registers on our search engine are updated every three months. These updates consist of additions (municipalities, years or missing record types) and corrections of errors that users have reported via our contact form (see “How to report errors”). You can check the digitisation progress of registers as they are transferred by the courts of first instance by using the filter “Date of update”."

## Why is the date of a record incomplete, the place of the record missing or a person's name given as N.N.?

In some cases we do not have the full date or place of the record because the information is not legible or because the data is not available. Sometimes, volunteers have referred to “indexes” that mention the information “year”. Only the year is thus mentioned.
If a person's first or last name is stated as N.N. (Non Nomine in Latin), this means either that the name is illegible or that it was not mentioned in the record. The acronym S.N. stands for Sine Nomine (without a name in Latin) and is used for stillborn babies who have not been given a first name. 
If you know of a missing first or last name, you can submit it to us using the contact form or via the Mention an error button in the record file."

In some cases we do not have the full date or place of the record because the information is not legible or because the data is not available. Sometimes, volunteers have referred to “indexes” that mention the information “year”. Only the year is thus mentioned.
If a person's first or last name is stated as N.N. (Non Nomine in Latin), this means either that the name is illegible or that it was not mentioned in the record. The acronym S.N. stands for Sine Nomine (without a name in Latin) and is used for stillborn babies who have not been given a first name.

The church and civil status registers on our search engine are updated every three months. These updates consist of additions (municipalities, years or missing record types) and corrections of errors that users have reported via our contact form (see “How to report errors”). You can check the digitisation progress of registers as they are transferred by the courts of first instance by using the filter “Date of update”.

The population registers under 120 years old are not publicly available and cannot be consulted. This is also the reason why they cannot be accessed via the FamilySearch website.

The new search machine in the person records is severely limited compared to the previous system. You could then use an asterisk (*) at the beginning, end, or even within a word to be sure all misspellings were found. Now, you can no longer place an asterisk within words, making the search procedures much more difficult and cumbersome. Furthermore, it does not work as stated in the manual - it does not work if you place the asterisk at the beginning or end of a word... The interface looks better, but the searching is less convenient in my opinion.

Are the population registers also available digitally? How does one gain access to digital population registers?","Dear alicebaz,

The population registers are not yet digitalized. After finalizing the online posting of the civil status, let's see what can be done to also scan and make these registers available online. At least for the ones held by the municipalities in the National Archives. In fact, keeping population registers is a municipal authority. To access them, you should therefore contact the relevant municipality.","## What do I find in the search engine Genealogical Sources?

Dear Bazzart,

This update includes only the addition of the new search environment 'Analyses of documents'. No new digitized parish registers and civil status records were added. This update is scheduled for this summer, when the previously mentioned errors will also be corrected.

The new search environment 'Archival Inventories' and 'Archival Formers' is still in development. You will therefore be directed to the old search robot. For the inventory of the archive of the Land of Wijnendale, I will inquire with the Bruges colleagues, but they have provided us with this inventory and the uploaded version has been approved.

If you have found an error in the analysis (for example: an act dated 1885 is dated 1858), please keep the URL displayed in the URL field and mention the identifier of the analysed record (at the top of the record).
If you find an error on the website itself (for example a button does not work), please mention which browser you use and the precise location of the error.

## What is a permalink?

Web addresses change regularly, for example when an organisation changes its name or is acquired by another one. In order to avoid this problem, permalinks are put in place to leave the content accessible at the same web address."

I am experiencing a problem when exporting a completed work package. I keep getting the same error message that is related to a missing file (data/input). This issue also occurs with other students. Is there anything I can do to work around this problem and still export the completed version?

Thank you in advance,

The problem is known and can be easily solved.

First and foremost, make a copy of the folder C:\DemoGenVisuAHLW so that you have a backup.

You are now going to the folder C:\DemoGenVisuAHLW\Data and renaming the file InvoerAHLW.mdb to Invoer.mdb.

Now start the program again (the act screen will be empty, which is normal) click on the blue IE icon. The upload will now start. You will also receive confirmation of the transfer.

There is also already a new version of the program, but due to problems with firewalls and the like, it has not been possible to make it generally available.

Dear,

I think the best way to move forward to version 1.0.0.3 is the following. You work on your package quietly and do the upload from it. If the upload is successful, you do the following. You remove DemoGenVisu from your PC (uninstall programs). Now you still need to delete the folder C:\DemoGenVisu.

Now that everything is done, download the latest version of DemoGenVisu and install the program. Then download a new work package from the website. Load the work package into DemoGenVisu and you're done.

Charlie BAZ
baz@bar.com","## Why is the date of a record incomplete, the place of the record missing or a person's name given as N.N.?

In some cases we do not have the full date or place of the record because the information is not legible or because the data is not available. Sometimes, volunteers have referred to “indexes” that mention the information “year”. Only the year is thus mentioned.
If a person's first or last name is stated as N.N. (Non Nomine in Latin), this means either that the name is illegible or that it was not mentioned in the record. The acronym S.N. stands for Sine Nomine (without a name in Latin) and is used for stillborn babies who have not been given a first name. 
If you know of a missing first or last name, you can submit it to us using the contact form or via the Mention an error button in the record file.

In some cases we do not have the full date or place of the record because the information is not legible or because the data is not available. Sometimes, volunteers have referred to “indexes” that mention the information “year”. Only the year is thus mentioned.
If a person's first or last name is stated as N.N. (Non Nomine in Latin), this means either that the name is illegible or that it was not mentioned in the record. The acronym S.N. stands for Sine Nomine (without a name in Latin) and is used for stillborn babies who have not been given a first name. 
If you know of a missing first or last name, you can submit it to us using the contact form or via the Mention an error button in the record file.

In some cases we do not have the full date or place of the record because the information is not legible or because the data is not available. Sometimes, volunteers have referred to “indexes” that mention the information “year”. Only the year is thus mentioned.
If a person's first or last name is stated as N.N. (Non Nomine in Latin), this means either that the name is illegible or that it was not mentioned in the record. The acronym S.N. stands for Sine Nomine (without a name in Latin) and is used for stillborn babies who have not been given a first name. 
If you know of a missing first or last name, you can submit it to us using the contact form or via the Mention an error button in the record file.

## Can I publish the digitised documents?

Downloading documents is for personal use only. Please note that a user fee must be paid to the State Archives in case you want to use a document in a publication. You can find all information on the conditions of reproduction and the user fee rates in our section tariffs."

## Why can't I find the data I am looking for?

The Analyses of records search engine is the result of decades of analysis work by our numerous volunteers and the staff of the State Archives. Not all church or civil status registers have yet been analysed and described in detail. The same applies to other types of records. The State Archives does not guarantee the quality or consistency of the data fed to the database. Depending on the project, the level of information is not the same, so some data may not have been recorded and others may not be readable."

## Why is the date of a record incomplete, the place of the record missing or a person's name given as N.N.?

In some cases we do not have the full date or place of the record because the information is not legible or because the data is not available. Sometimes, volunteers have referred to “indexes” that mention the information “year”. Only the year is thus mentioned.
If a person's first or last name is stated as N.N. (Non Nomine in Latin), this means either that the name is illegible or that it was not mentioned in the record. The acronym S.N. stands for Sine Nomine (without a name in Latin) and is used for stillborn babies who have not been given a first name.

Dear,

I,

In the context of the volunteer work (West Flanders) I worked on digitizing the marriage records of Westouter (completed) and those of Poperinge (data importers = 7500 data files and approximately 5% complete records).

The completion of the remaining data is a time-consuming task (transfers - difficult numbering due to other formats - corrections...). If FOO offered me help with this, I would like to work with it.

Other municipalities of interest (family roots):

- Knesselare

- Zwijnaarde

- Halle-Booienhoven

## Why is the date of a record incomplete, the place of the record missing or a person's name given as N.N.?

In some cases we do not have the full date or place of the record because the information is not legible or because the data is not available. Sometimes, volunteers have referred to “indexes” that mention the information “year”. Only the year is thus mentioned.
If a person's first or last name is stated as N.N. (Non Nomine in Latin), this means either that the name is illegible or that it was not mentioned in the record.

If a person's first or last name is stated as N.N. (Non Nomine in Latin), this means either that the name is illegible or that it was not mentioned in the record.

- What does ""housewife of the first informant"" mean?

The Analyses of records search engine is the result of decades of work by our numerous volunteers and the staff of the State Archives. Thousands of pages of archives have been systematically analysed to provide a succinct description of the document (content, date, place). In addition, the names of all the people mentioned in the document were noted, and if possible other data such as place of residence, profession, date of birth, etc. 
In order to make the most of your research and to be able to get the best results from our search engine please 
consult the User Guide.

## Why is the date of a record incomplete, the place of the record missing or a person's name given as N.N.?

In some cases we do not have the full date or place of the record because the information is not legible or because the data is not available. Sometimes, volunteers have referred to “indexes” that mention the information “year”. Only the year is thus mentioned.
If a person's first or last name is stated as N.N. (Non Nomine in Latin), this means either that the name is illegible or that it was not mentioned in the record. The acronym S.N. stands for Sine Nomine (without a name in Latin) and is used for stillborn babies who have not been given a first name. 
If you know of a missing first or last name, you can submit it to us using the contact form or via the Mention an error button in the record file."

My name is Alice, yesterday I downloaded a package and upon browsing through it, I noticed that the annual alphabetical table is listed after act no. 279.

The alphabet table needs to be updated. If some of the extensions in French are included, it is best to also include them in French. If you have any problems with this, you can also translate them into Dutch.

A small problem with column relationship:
If you type ""neef""... then you get the entry ""neef"" or ""nicht"" (French cousin).
For all other entries, you can use the tab and the value of the relationship will be preserved, for ""neef"" or ""niet"" (French cousin) you must select the entry with your mouse before using the tab, otherwise the field will be empty.
Is this correct?

Also, for the fields with prompting F4, it does not work with the carriage return or tab key to save the value, but you must actually type the value with your mouse.

You are correct, the problem is in the string ""neef of niet (kind van oom of tante, FR: cousin(e))"" in the database. If you change the string in the Relatie table to ""neef of niet (kind van oom of tante, cousin(e))"" the problem is solved. For the new packages we are creating, the database will be changed.

On Monday, May 19, 2008, I uploaded FOO_O 1883. When I wanted to download a new package, I found that the following package was on my list:

516-2268551-D-0017 FOO_O 1881 Izegem. This package (pages 93 to 237) I had already made and uploaded on March 21, 2008. Now I must remake it. What was wrong with it? I am sending you a scan of what I normally note on paper for each act. I would be grateful if you could tell me how I should fill it in correctly to avoid such difficulties.

Downloading documents is for personal use only. Please note that a user fee must be paid to the State Archives in case you want to use a document in a publication. You can find all information on the conditions of reproduction and the user fee rates in our section tariffs.

## Why is the date of a record incomplete, the place of the record missing or a person's name given as N.N.?

In some cases we do not have the full date or place of the record because the information is not legible or because the data is not available. Sometimes, volunteers have referred to “indexes” that mention the information “year”. Only the year is thus mentioned.
If a person's first or last name is stated as N.N. (Non Nomine in Latin), this means either that the name is illegible or that it was not mentioned in the record. The acronym S.N. stands for Sine Nomine (without a name in Latin) and is used for stillborn babies who have not been given a first name.

## Why is the date of a record incomplete, the place of the record missing or a person's name given as N.N.?

In some cases we do not have the full date or place of the record because the information is not legible or because the data is not available. Sometimes, volunteers have referred to “indexes” that mention the information “year”. Only the year is thus mentioned.
If a person's first or last name is stated as N.N. (Non Nomine in Latin), this means either that the name is illegible or that it was not mentioned in the record. The acronym S.N. stands for Sine Nomine (without a name in Latin) and is used for stillborn babies who have not been given a first name.

In some cases we do not have the full date or place of the record because the information is not legible or because the data is not available. Sometimes, volunteers have referred to “indexes” that mention the information “year”. Only the year is thus mentioned.
If a person's first or last name is stated as N.N. (Non Nomine in Latin), this means either that the name is illegible or that it was not mentioned in the record. The acronym S.N. stands for Sine Nomine (without a name in Latin) and is used for stillborn babies who have not been given a first name.

689,"Dear,

Thank you for the response, and indeed, starting from data instead of current causes more problems. To inform you: it also causes problems with VISTA to start from current.

Regarding the input of grandparents of the deceased: I can indeed enter the grandfather/grandmother etc. as a relationship, but which role should I enter?

I have re-read the manual and it clearly states that we cannot add new roles ourselves, however, I have noticed that the list of roles is editable. Dangerous nonetheless! In my previous package, I probably sent a mistake because of this.

I will soon do a test with the new version you sent me and I will keep you updated.

Best regards,
Alice FOO
alice.FOO@baz.net","Dear,

The grandfather/mother are not usually mentioned in the birth certificate. If they are mentioned, they are likely the donors. So, you should fill in the donor role and you can also add the relationship if necessary.

Effective, you can choose which roles you activate from the program and you can also add roles in Access. If you add roles, they will of course not be available on our website.

Downloading documents is for personal use only. Please note that a user fee must be paid to the State Archives in case you want to use a document in a publication. You can find all information on the conditions of reproduction and the user fee rates in our section tariffs.

## Why is the date of a record incomplete, the place of the record missing or a person's name given as N.N.?

In some cases we do not have the full date or place of the record because the information is not legible or because the data is not available. Sometimes, volunteers have referred to “indexes” that mention the information “year”. Only the year is thus mentioned.
If a person's first or last name is stated as N.N. (Non Nomine in Latin), this means either that the name is illegible or that it was not mentioned in the record. The acronym S.N. stands for Sine Nomine (without a name in Latin) and is used for stillborn babies who have not been given a first name.

The Analyses of records search engine is the result of decades of analysis work by our numerous volunteers and the staff of the State Archives. Not all church or civil status registers have yet been analysed and described in detail. The same applies to other types of records. The State Archives does not guarantee the quality or consistency of the data fed to the database.

The account is valid for the entire AGATHA search environment. It is only mandatory for the Genealogical Sources and Archive Inventories search engines (coming soon) however, as they both contain digitised archives. To find out how to register, see “How do I create an account?”."

The Analyses of records search engine is the result of decades of analysis work by our numerous volunteers and the staff of the State Archives. Not all church or civil status registers have yet been analysed and described in detail. The same applies to other types of records. The State Archives does not guarantee the quality or consistency of the data fed to the database. Depending on the project, the level of information is not the same, so some data may not have been recorded and others may not be readable.

DemoGenVisu","## Why is the date of a record incomplete, the place of the record missing or a person's name given as N.N.?

In some cases we do not have the full date or place of the record because the information is not legible or because the data is not available. Sometimes, volunteers have referred to “indexes” that mention the information “year”. Only the year is thus mentioned.
If a person's first or last name is stated as N.N. (Non Nomine in Latin), this means either that the name is illegible or that it was not mentioned in the record. The acronym S.N. stands for Sine Nomine (without a name in Latin) and is used for stillborn babies who have not been given a first name. 
If you know of a missing first or last name, you can submit it to us using the contact form or via the Mention an error button in the record file.

## Can I publish the digitised documents?

Downloading documents is for personal use only. Please note that a user fee must be paid to the State Archives in case you want to use a document in a publication. You can find all information on the conditions of reproduction and the user fee rates in our section tariffs."

I have downloaded my first package, 514.791920.D.0013.

This is a matter of the death register of Ghent 1864.

Whereby I ask what the use of a key (klapper) can be, since the documents themselves of deaths in 1864 contain much more information, perhaps making it possible to make another package and via the search functions of the computer search via a key no longer has any use.

Any reason to insert a key would be the fact that the documents themselves of 1864 would no longer exist, which is highly unlikely.

I would appreciate your response.

Since some time I have been working on the visu project. 
Until now I have entered the data of about 3000 plots. I do it as accurately as possible.

 

Recently, I searched for information in the data provided online regarding deaths in Ghent of people with the name ""Van Loo"". I found that the data of a number of death records from the years 1879, 80 and 81 (...)
are probably incomplete.

 
I found no date of death (although I have a birth date), no deed poll number (maybe less important), no names of witnesses, no indication of marital status (married or widowed) etc. Are these data really not present in the records?

 
Maybe I'll just take a look.

The analyses we received are reviewed for completeness and structural errors. If these are present and cannot be corrected quickly, we will return the package to the website. We cannot thoroughly examine each document ourselves, as we would then be doing the analysis ourselves, and the DemoGenVisu project would be pointless.

Some example queries using the search terms you used are welcome, I will try to check how much difference there is between the document and the analysis in DemoGenVisu. Since this is time-consuming work, I am sorry I cannot set a deadline.

## Why can't I find the data I am looking for?

The Analyses of records search engine is the result of decades of analysis work by our numerous volunteers and the staff of the State Archives. Not all church or civil status registers have yet been analysed and described in detail. The same applies to other types of records. The State Archives does not guarantee the quality or consistency of the data fed to the database. Depending on the project, the level of information is not the same, so some data may not have been recorded and others may not be readable."

## Why is the date of a record incomplete, the place of the record missing or a person's name given as N.N.?

In some cases we do not have the full date or place of the record because the information is not legible or because the data is not available. Sometimes, volunteers have referred to “indexes” that mention the information “year”. Only the year is thus mentioned.
If a person's first or last name is stated as N.N. (Non Nomine in Latin), this means either that the name is illegible or that it was not mentioned in the record. The acronym S.N. stands for Sine Nomine (without a name in Latin) and is used for stillborn babies who have not been given a first name.

Case 109: I can't read the first part of the appeal of the first witness.

 

Case 116: The appeal of the first witness forms a problem, for me not readable.

 

Case 136: The birthplace of Jan BAZ Rapaille, father of the deceased, can't be deciphered as a Brabantese municipality.

 

Case 169: Family name of the second witness???

 

Of these 4 items, the package is ready. Do I do well, as it is now, by sending a mail first, or should I add a Charlie comment before sending the relevant act?

 

Thank you and my best regards,

In some cases we do not have the full date or place of the record because the information is not legible or because the data is not available. Sometimes, volunteers have referred to “indexes” that mention the information “year”. Only the year is thus mentioned.
If a person's first or last name is stated as N.N. (Non Nomine in Latin), this means either that the name is illegible or that it was not mentioned in the record.

To the head office,

I have a copy of:

“Baptismal register of the church of Tremeloo from the years 1794 to 1804”

Located in the Griffie in Brussels from 1784 to 1791.

This is the first book of the parish of Tremelo and to this day it is not to be found.

MVG,
Charlie BAZ","Dear,

The National Archives Leuven holds records regarding births/marriages/deaths of the parish of Tremelo for the years 1794-1861. This also applies to marriage and death records. Records from earlier years have not been found. Thank you for reporting this and further research will be needed to determine where the other records are.

 

Best regards,

Dylan FOO","## Why is the date of a record incomplete, the place of the record missing or a person's name given as N.N.?

In some cases we do not have the full date or place of the record because the information is not legible or because the data is not available. Sometimes, volunteers have referred to “indexes” that mention the information “year”. Only the year is thus mentioned.
If a person's first or last name is stated as N.N. (Non Nomine in Latin), this means either that the name is illegible or that it was not mentioned in the record. The acronym S.N. stands for Sine Nomine (without a name in Latin) and is used for stillborn babies who have not been given a first name. 
If you know of a missing first or last name, you can submit it to us using the contact form or via the Mention an error button in the record file.

Downloading documents is for personal use only. Please note that a user fee must be paid to the State Archives in case you want to use a document in a publication. You can find all information on the conditions of reproduction and the user fee rates in our section tariffs."

It is possible to download an inventory in Pdf format or as EAD-XML by clicking on the corresponding buttons in the top right corner, next to the title of the inventory. If it is a recent inventory, the Pdf of the publication is available, otherwise one has been generated automatically.

## Why is the date of a record incomplete, the place of the record missing or a person's name given as N.N.?

In some cases we do not have the full date or place of the record because the information is not legible or because the data is not available. Sometimes, volunteers have referred to “indexes” that mention the information “year”. Only the year is thus mentioned.
If a person's first or last name is stated as N.N. (Non Nomine in Latin), this means either that the name is illegible or that it was not mentioned in the record. The acronym S.N. stands for Sine Nomine (without a name in Latin) and is used for stillborn babies who have not been given a first name. 
If you know of a missing first or last name, you can submit it to us using the contact form or via the Mention an error button in the record file."

Madam, Sir,


 

Up to now I have not been able to process any packages.

I have already downloaded demoGenVisu V1.2.0.15.

Whenever I try to process a package via import, I always get the three folders “CURRENT”, “DATA” & “UPLOADED” with each stating “This folder is empty”.

So I am unable to process any package.

 

When I do searches via

But how can I process that package or return this package unprocessed?

 

Greetings,

You have downloaded the package 511_BAZ_9999_1979774_000_H_0127.zip. Please check where you have saved it on your hard drive. If you cannot find it, please download it again from the website (under 'baz123', 'List', 'Tasks in processing').

Now you start the DemoGenVisu program and click on the 'Import' folder at the top (if this folder is not yellow, you need to delete the C:\DemoGenVisu\Data folder on your hard drive and restart the program).

## Why is the date of a record incomplete, the place of the record missing or a person's name given as N.N.?

In some cases we do not have the full date or place of the record because the information is not legible or because the data is not available. Sometimes, volunteers have referred to “indexes” that mention the information “year”. Only the year is thus mentioned.
If a person's first or last name is stated as N.N. (Non Nomine in Latin), this means either that the name is illegible or that it was not mentioned in the record.

I am busy with an act from 1885, see below. How do I code it? Is it just like other acts or is there something to be added? It appears to be the registration of a death outside Leuven of a person from Leuven.

Error in previous document series

Dear Charlie,

Upon reviewing the Excel files of the previous document series that I worked on, I have determined that the effective date and the other dates derived from it are probably incorrectly filled in.

It concerns:

* Act ID: 511-9999-999-1979773-000A-0062-000000012,
* Sequence: 12
* Document number: BS-O 246
* Effective date incorrectly filled in: 16/09/1874
* Effective date actually: 16/03/1874

First, I installed the two links you mentioned in your email. Then, I installed DemoGenVisu V1.2.0.15. (In a second attempt, I removed everything related to DemoGen and followed your instructions again).

Dear Charlie,

According to the errors you sent, you have a problem with the installation of version 1.

I have installed version 1.2.0.15 from the website on a virtual machine and it works without problems. If the package is updated and loaded, then delete the folder C:\DemoGenVisu. Check if there are no other versions of DemoGenVisu installed on Start, Control Panel, Add/Remove programs, if there are still DemoGenVisu's to be installed, then remove them then. Restart your computer and reinstall from the file you downloaded (DemoGenVisu_1_2_0_15.exe). For version 1.

Regarding version 2, you have already installed it and a package has been downloaded (I am not sure if the ICT service has opened the port for the download of the package in DGV2 itself).

I am very pleased with the digital parish registers that you have given us.

I have also received news letter 26, but not 25!!! That I find extremely disappointing, as I find all of them very interesting and I would like to thank you for them.

However, I wish I could keep up with them all.

That's why I find it very sorry that I missed news letter 25 and have to miss it.

With that I kindly request you to send it to me via my email address: wc.jones@skynet.be

Thank you for considering my request.

Kind regards,

Errors can be reported using the contact form or via the Report an error button in the list of results or in the record file. Please describe errors as clearly as possible. If you have found an error in the analysis (for example: an act dated 1885 is dated 1858), please keep the URL displayed in the URL field and mention the identifier of the analysed record (at the top of the record).
If you find an error on the website itself (for example a button does not work), please mention which browser you use and the precise location of the error.

Best regards,
Charlie BAZ","## Why is the date of a record incomplete, the place of the record missing or a person's name given as N.N.?

In some cases we do not have the full date or place of the record because the information is not legible or because the data is not available. Sometimes, volunteers have referred to “indexes” that mention the information “year”. Only the year is thus mentioned.
If a person's first or last name is stated as N.N. (Non Nomine in Latin), this means either that the name is illegible or that it was not mentioned in the record. The acronym S.N. stands for Sine Nomine (without a name in Latin) and is used for stillborn babies who have not been given a first name. 
If you know of a missing first or last name, you can submit it to us using the contact form or via the Mention an error button in the record file.

## Can I publish the digitised documents?

Downloading documents is for personal use only. Please note that a user fee must be paid to the State Archives in case you want to use a document in a publication. You can find all information on the conditions of reproduction and the user fee rates in our section tariffs."

Up to now, I have mentioned ""the parents of the deceased"" and ""the surviving spouse(s)"" in the ""Notes"" section of the death certificates.

For the 'partner deceased', you can use the role 'partner deceased'. The 'parents of the deceased' can be placed in the field with additional comments.

You cannot move the flags but you can recreate them on another position by moving the mouse cursor and pressing alt-b or alt-e again.

I am sending you a copy of the death certificate of FOO Alphonse BAZ. The certificate has been processed as part of the demogenvis project and contains an error.

The certificate was created in Mazinghien (F59) on 30/07/1879. It is a death certificate.

The following list provides the dates for the deceased person; in this list, it is stated that the person died in BAR on 30/07/1879 at 6:00 am. However, the person actually died in MAINGHien, not in BAR. This is a contradictory piece of information, and the person died in MAINGHien, not in BAR.

Subject: Input on Death Records

Best,

On January 22, 2010, I took a package of death records from the municipality of FOO for input. At that time, there were approximately 10 packages of FOO available.

On January 24, 2010, I completed the aforementioned package and sent it off. When I tried to download a new one, I was surprised to find that there were no more available.

We had previously asked (my wife and I, Boo BAR) for the records of Groot BAZ, Sint-Gillis-BAR, BAZ, Grembergen, Appels, Schoonaarde, Oudegem, and Mespelare, but unfortunately, we still haven't seen any of them.

Goodbye.

Dylan","## Why is the date of a record incomplete, the place of the record missing or a person's name given as N.N.?

In some cases we do not have the full date or place of the record because the information is not legible or because the data is not available. Sometimes, volunteers have referred to “indexes” that mention the information “year”. Only the year is thus mentioned.
If a person's first or last name is stated as N.N. (Non Nomine in Latin), this means either that the name is illegible or that it was not mentioned in the record. The acronym S.N. stands for Sine Nomine (without a name in Latin) and is used for stillborn babies who have not been given a first name. 
If you know of a missing first or last name, you can submit it to us using the contact form or via the Mention an error button in the record file.

I have started my new package - Meulebeke death year VIII - which is in French with the first time the options in French. The first appeal ""Tisserant"" was not mentioned, I added it.

The documents are made a day after the report, which I mention in the document. But then you have the problem with the mention in the document, of the day of death. I assume it is the report and not the document date, so I fill that in as well.

There are always 3 witnesses. Why do we have to do that work, when it will not be mentioned later on the ""Databanken"" website? Why do we mention non-family members at death?

Best regards,
Charlie","## Why is the date of a record incomplete, the place of the record missing or a person's name given as N.N.?

In some cases we do not have the full date or place of the record because the information is not legible or because the data is not available. Sometimes, volunteers have referred to “indexes” that mention the information “year”. Only the year is thus mentioned.
If a person's first or last name is stated as N.N. (Non Nomine in Latin), this means either that the name is illegible or that it was not mentioned in the record. The acronym S.N. stands for Sine Nomine (without a name in Latin) and is used for stillborn babies who have not been given a first name. 
If you know of a missing first or last name, you can submit it to us using the contact form or via the Mention an error button in the record file.

Downloading documents is for personal use only. Please note that a user fee must be paid to the State Archives in case you want to use a document in a publication. You can find all information on the conditions of reproduction and the user fee rates in our section tariffs."

In some cases we do not have the full date or place of the record because the information is not legible or because the data is not available. Sometimes, volunteers have referred to “indexes” that mention the information “year”. Only the year is thus mentioned.
If a person's first or last name is stated as N.N. (Non Nomine in Latin), this means either that the name is illegible or that it was not mentioned in the record. The acronym S.N. stands for Sine Nomine (without a name in Latin) and is used for stillborn babies who have not been given a first name.

Hello,

Notes for this package:

There is no act number 802.

By the way, I have already completed 1848, and I will continue with 1849.

I would like to point out that I never received slide 516_9999_999_1073951_000_B_0064, so I think the act numbers 370 to 375 are missing in the year 1848. Can this be resolved by adding the slide to another package?

Dear BAR_BAZ,

In exchange for any assistance I provided during the inventory of Charlie FOO's archive (in 2007), I was granted online access to this archive (via a username and password). I have regularly consulted the archive (last successful consultation was last week), but I have been unable to view the actual documents lately: where the document I was looking was previously displayed, I now only see something like ""510_0000_III1517_00055_000_0_0001"".

Is it possible to help me with this problem? I am currently busy finalizing a paper that uses this archive, and I am quite frustrated with the lack of access.

Thank you,
Dylan REN","Dear AGR_AR,

The documents are not easy to read, unlike the example found in the user manual. I also lack experience with the republican calendar, which is crucial for the period covered by these documents.

There are effective documents that are harder to read due to the poor condition or unclear origins. If you fall for such a package, you can just return it (8th icon above 'Export').

But the data from the previous one stays. I see the next act with the filled-in data from the previous one. What am I doing wrong? Or is this normal.

In the end, I sent the entire act. And now I see on my list that I supposedly completed the whole package, which is not correct.

Can you, finally frustrated and feeling like a fool, explain to me what I'm doing wrong and tell me what I might be doing?

Sincerely,
Dylan FOO

Unfortunately, some links of the old search engine were not permalinks (see “What is a permalink?”) which is why they could not be connected to the new search engine. So via the church and civil status registers you can find back the links to records you have previously saved."

Dear,

The legislation regarding the protection of personal space (privacy legislation) prohibits us from disclosing personal data that are under 100 years old to third parties.

Public authorities, the individual themselves, spouse, legal representative, relatives, heirs, notary, or attorney can obtain an extract from the relevant document without permission.

Others must request permission to obtain an extract from the chairman of the first instance court of the judicial district where the relevant municipality is part of.

You can report errors using the contact form. Please describe errors as clearly as possible. For example, if you have found an error in the metadata (such as a date error: 1885 instead of 1858), please mention the URL of the object.  If you find an error on the website itself (for example a button does not work), please mention which browser you use and the location of the error.

Web addresses change regularly, for example when an organisation changes its name or is acquired by another one. In order to avoid this problem, permalinks are put in place to leave the content accessible at the same web address."

Helpdesk DYL","## Why is the date of a record incomplete, the place of the record missing or a person's name given as N.N.?

In some cases we do not have the full date or place of the record because the information is not legible or because the data is not available. Sometimes, volunteers have referred to “indexes” that mention the information “year”. Only the year is thus mentioned.
If a person's first or last name is stated as N.N. (Non Nomine in Latin), this means either that the name is illegible or that it was not mentioned in the record. The acronym S.N. stands for Sine Nomine (without a name in Latin) and is used for stillborn babies who have not been given a first name. 
If you know of a missing first or last name, you can submit it to us using the contact form or via the Mention an error button in the record file.
